              "' Unterscheidung between data lakehouse and data warehouse is a common topic of discussion in the data engineering community, as both are designed to store large amounts of data but have different architectures, use cases, and benefits. A data lakehouse is a centralized repository that stores all the raw data from various sources in its original form, without transforming or processing it. On the other hand, a data warehouse is a structured repository that stores data in a specific format, typically after cleaning, transforming, and aggregating it.\\n\\nHere are some key differences between a data lakehouse and a data warehouse:\\n\\n1. Data Structure: A data lakehouse stores data in its raw, unprocessed form, while a data warehouse stores data in a structured format, typically after cleaning, transforming, and aggregating it.\\n2. Data Sources: A data lakehouse can ingest data from various sources, including databases, APIs, files, and streaming data sources, while a data warehouse typically ingests data from a limited number of sources, such as transactional systems or external databases.\\n3. Data Processing: A data lakehouse does not process data, whereas a data warehouse performs extensive data processing, including data cleansing, transformation, and aggregation, to make the data ready for analysis.\\n4. Analytics Workloads: A data lakehouse is optimized for advanced analytics workloads, such as machine learning, data science, and real-time analytics, while a data warehouse is optimized for reporting and querying.\\n5. Cost: A data lakehouse can be more cost-effective than a data warehouse, especially for large datasets, as it does not require the same level of data processing and transformation as a data warehouse.\\n6. Governance: A data lakehouse provides better governance capabilities than a data warehouse, as it allows for easier management of data access and security, with features like row-level security and data masking.\\n7. Scalability: A data lakehouse is highly scalable and can handle large volumes of data, making it an ideal choice for organizations with growing data needs.\\n8. Flexibility: A data lakehouse offers greater flexibility than a data warehouse, as it can accommodate various data formats and structures, and can be easily integrated with other data storage systems.\\n9.

The specifications so \\nworked out should meet the basic nee ds of the organization without \\nincluding superfluous and non-essent ial features, which may result in \\nunwarranted expenditure.

The procurement function has also been decentralized and most \\nof the defence organizations  undertake bulk of the central procurement \\nand local purchase themselves. While DGS&D continues to  conclude Rate \\nContracts for supply of general use items, service specific items are being \\nprocured by the procurement agencies of the Service concerned. It must \\nbe ensured that all procurement officers  meticulously follow the laid down \\nprocedures. \\n \\n2.3.2  Delegation of Powers : With the objective of decentralizing powers to \\nenable effective use of resources by t he actual operators, financial powers \\nhave been delegated to various authorit ies in the defence establishments \\ndown to the unit commanders. These powers are to be used within the \\nframework of laid down procedures , cannons of financial propriety and \\namplificatory instructions. The po wers so delegated also imply \\naccountability and the CFAs must en sure that financial propriety and \\nprobity are observed in all cases.     \\n \\n2.4 Types of Procurement  \\n \\n2.4.1  Capital Procurement : As per Rule 90 of the General Financial Rules, \\n2005, significant expenditure incurred wi th the object of acquiring tangible \\nassets of a permanent nature (for use in  the organization and not for sale \\nin the ordinary course of business) or enhancing the utility of the existing \\nassets, shall broadly be defined as Ca pital expenditure. Further, as per \\nRule 91 (a) of the General Financia l Rules, 2005, Capital shall bear all \\ncharges for the first construction an d equipment of a project as well as \\ncharges for intermediate mai ntenance of the work while not yet opened for \\nservice. It shall also bear char ges for such further additions and \\nimprovements, which enhance the us eful life of the asset. Capital \\nprocurement would, therefore, refe r to procurement of all goods and \\nservices that fit the description of capital expenditure. The procedure for \\ncapital procurement is separately la id down in the Defence Procurement \\nProcedure, 2008.   \\n 2.4.2  Revenue Procurement\\n: As per Rule 91 of the General Financial Rules, \\n2005, revenue should bear all subseque nt charges for maintenance and ', metadata={'source': 'documents/documents/documents/DPM2009.pdf', 'page': 17}),\n",

It is  the policy of the Government  to encourage \\nindigenization, particularly in the fiel d of defence to achieve self-reliance. \\nHence, indigenous firms should be given all support to produce and \\nsupply quality goods conforming to sp ecifications.

However, commercial \\nnegotiation may become necessary to ensu re that the interest of the State \\nis fully protected and the price pa id is reasonable. Commercial \\nnegotiations are invariably conducted in  case of single tender situations, \\nincluding PAC cases, or w hen price is considered high with reference to \\nassessed reasonable price, irrespective  of the nature of tendering. Such \\nnegotiations are invariably conducted  by a duly appointed Commercial \\nNegotiation Committee (CNC), which sh ould invariably include a finance \\nmember, unless the negotiation is carried  out by the committee CFA itself.  \\n \\n4.13.4 Composition of CNC : Apart from the Chairman, there should be \\nrepresentatives of the User, Integr ated Finance, designated Inspecting \\nAgency, Maintenance Agency, Director ate concerned with post-contract \\nmanagement and the CFA, wherever applicable.

Availability of funds should be determined only  after accounting for \\ncash outgo during the relevant fina ncial year on account of committed \\nliabilities . \\n  \\n5.2.5  Processing of Proposals Without Li nking Them With Availability of \\nFunds : Subject to the general rule that  purchase proposals should be \\nprocessed with due regard to availabi lity of funds, a procurement proposal \\nmay be processed without linking it with actual availability of funds, if it is certified by the budget holder that ther e is reasonable certainty of funds \\nbecoming available by the time the proposal reaches the final stage of contracting/placing of supp ly order.

In \\norder to ensure that there is no in fructuous provisioning, the IFA must \\nhave access to all inputs required to assess the basis of the projection of indented quantity.

Where financial powers are to be exercised with the \\nconcurrence of integrated finance, IF A should vet the quantity of such \\nitems if the procurement is propos ed to be made under the delegated \\nfinancial powers exercisable with the concurrence of integrated finance.

One of the important responsibilities  of the \\nCFA to ensure  proper ranking of all offers so that the decision making \\nprocess is totally transparent. The financial implication should be considered as the all-inclusive cost  to the User on delivery to the \\ndesignated consignee(s). Conditional offe rs and those with specifications \\nnot in conformity with the tendered s pecifications (Essential QRs) should \\nnot be considered.

The law relating to  redressal of disputes is laid down \\nin the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,  1996. Some of the salient principles \\nrelating to contracts are set out briefly in this chapter. \\n \\n6.1.2 Applicability to Defence Procurement : Government contracts, including \\nthose for defence procur ement, are governed by the same laws which are \\napplicable to contracts between private parties.     \\n6.2   Elementary Legal Practices\\n \\n \\n6.2.1  What is a Contract? : The proposal or offer when accepted is a promise, a \\npromise and every set of promises forming the consideration for each \\nother is an agreement, and an agreement if made with free consent of \\nparties competent to contract, for a lawful consideration and with a lawful object is a contract. \\n  6.2.2  Proposal or Offer\\n: When one person signifies to  another his willingness to \\ndo or to abstain from doing anything, wi th a view to obtaining the assent of \\nthe other to such act or abstinence, he is  said to make a proposal or offer. \\nIn a sale or purchase by tender, the tender signed by t he tenderer is the \\nproposal. The invitation to tender an d instructions to tenderers do not \\nconstitute a proposal. \\n  \\n6.2.3  Acceptance of the Proposal : When the person to whom the proposal is \\nmade signifies his assent thereto, th e proposal is said to be accepted. A \\nproposal when accepted becomes a promise. \\n \\n6.2.4 Which agreements are Contracts ?: An agreement is a contract \\nenforceable by law when the following are satisfied. A de fect affecting any \\nof these renders a contract un-enforceable. \\n \\n(a) Competency of the parties (b) Freedom of consent of both parties (c) Lawfulness of consideration \\n(d) Lawfulness of object ', metadata={'source': 'documents/documents/documents/DPM2009.pdf', 'page': 61}),\n",

It, therefore, follows that minors and \\npersons of unsound mind cannot enter into contracts nor can insolvent \\nperson do so. \\n \\n6.3.2 Categories of Parties to the Contract : Categories of persons and bodies \\nwho are parties to the contract may be broadl y sub-divided under the \\nfollowing heads: -  \\n(a) Individuals \\n(b) Partnerships (c) Limited Companies \\n(d) Corporations other than limited companies \\n \\n6.3.3 Contracts with Individuals\\n: Individuals tender either in their own name or \\nin the name and style of their busines s. If the tender is signed by any \\nperson other than the concerned indivi dual, the authority of the person \\nsigning the tender on behalf of anot her must be verified and a proper \\npower of attorney authorizing such pe rson should be insisted on. In case, \\na tender is submitted in a business name and if it is a concern of an \\nindividual, the constitution of th e business and the capacity of the \\nindividual must appear on the face of the contract and the tender signed by the individual himself as propriet or or by his duly authorized attorney. \\n \\n6.3.4 Contracts with Partnerships\\n: A partnership is an association of two or \\nmore individuals formed for the purpos e of doing business jointly under a \\nbusiness name. It is also called a firm. It should be noted that a \\npartnership is not a legal entity by  itself, apart from the individuals \\nconstituting it. A partner is the impl ied authority to bind the firm in a \\ncontract coming in the purview of the usual business of the firm. The \\nimplied authority of a partner, howeve r, does not extend to enter into \\narbitration agreement on behalf of the firm. While entering into a contract \\nwith partnership firm care should be taken to verify the existence of \\nconsent of all the partners to  the arbitration agreement.  \\n \\n6.3.5 Contracts with Limited Companies : Companies are associations of \\nindividuals registered under Companies Act in which the liability of the \\nmembers comprising the association is limited to the extent of the shares \\nheld by them in such companies.

If any contract has to be \\nentered into with any on e of such corporations or associations, the \\ncapacity of such associations to enter into contract should be verified and \\nalso the authority of the person comi ng forward to represent the said \\nassociations. \\n \\n6.3.7  Parties to Defence Contracts : The parties to the defence contracts are \\nthe President of India as the purch aser acting through the authority \\nsigning the Contract/Agreement/Purch ase Order etc., and the supplier \\nnamed in the contract. \\n \\n6.4 Consent of both the Parties  \\n \\n6.4.1  Consent of Both Parties:   Two or more persons are said to consent \\nwhen they agree upon the same th ing in the same sense. When two \\npersons dealing with each other have  their minds directed to different \\nobjects or attach different meanings to  the language which they use, there \\nis no agreement. The misunderstandi ng which is incompatible with \\nagreement may occur in the following cases: - \\n \\n(a) When the misunderstanding relates to  the identity of the other party to \\nthe agreement; \\n(b) When it relates to the nature or terms of the transactions; (c) When it related to the s ubject matter of the agreement. \\n 6.4.2  Free Consent of the Parties\\n: The consent is said to be free when it is not \\ncaused by coercion, undue influence, fraud, misrepresent ation or mistake. \\nConsent is said to be so caused when  it would not have been given but for \\nthe existence of coercion, undue infl uence, fraud, misrepresentation or \\nmistake. When consent to an agree ment is caused by coercion, undue \\ninfluence, fraud or misrepresentation, the agreement is a contract voidable \\nat the option of the party whose consent was caused.

When both the \\nparties to an agreement ar e under a mistake as to a matter essential to the \\nagreement, the agreement is not voidab le but void. When the mistake is \\nunilateral on the part of one part y only, the agreement is not void. \\n 6.4.4 Mistake of Fact and Law\\n: Distinction has also to be drawn between a \\nmistake of fact and a mistake of law. A contract is not void because it was \\ncaused by a mistake as to any law in force in India but a mistake as to law \\nnot in force in India has the s ame effect as a mistake of fact. \\n \\n6.5 Consideration  \\n 6.5.1 What is Consideration?\\n Consideration is something which is \\nadvantageous to the promisor or whic h is onerous or disadvantageous to \\nthe promisee. Inadequacy of consid eration is, however, not a ground \\navoiding the contract. But an act, forbearance or promise, which in contemplation of law has no value, is  no consideration and likewise an act \\nor a promise, which is illegal or impossible, has no value. \\n \\n6.6 Lawfulness of Object\\n \\n 6.6.1  Lawfulness of Object\\n: The consideration or ob ject of an agreement is \\nlawful, unless it is forbidde n by law or is of such a nature that if permitted, \\nit would defeat the provisions of any la w, or is fraudulent or involves or \\nimplies injury to the fra udulent property of another or the court regards it \\nas immoral or opposed to public po licy. In each of these cases the \\nconsideration or object of an agre ement is said to be unlawful. \\n \\n6.7 Communication of an Offer/Proposal and Acceptance  \\n \\n6.7.1 Communication of an Offer or Proposal:  The communication of a \\nproposal is complete when it comes to the knowledge of the person to \\nwhom it is made. A time is generall y provided in the tender forms for \\nsubmission of the tender. Purchaser is not bound to consider a tender, \\nwhich is received beyond that time. \\n \\n6.7.2  Communication of Acceptance : A date is invariably fixed in tender forms \\nupto which tenders are open for accept ance. A proposal or offer stands \\nrevoked by the lapse of time prescribed in such offer for its acceptance.

The \\ncommunication of an acceptance is complete as against the proposer or \\nofferer, where it is put in the course of  transmission to him, so as to be out \\nof the power of the acceptor, and it is complete as against the acceptor \\nwhen it comes to the knowledge of th e proposer or offerer. The medium of \\ncommunication in government contra cts is generally by post and the \\nacceptance is, therefore, complete as soon as it is posted. So that there \\nmight be no possibility of a dispute re garding the date of communication of \\nacceptance, it should be sent to th e correct address by some authentic \\nfoolproof mode like registered po st acknowledgement due, etc. \\n \\n6.7.4 Acceptance to be Identical with Proposal: If the terms of the tender or \\nthe tender, as revised, and modified, are not accepted or  if the terms of \\nthe offer and the acceptance are not the same, the acceptance remains a \\nmere counter offer and there is no c oncluded contract. It should, therefore, \\nbe ensured that the terms incorpor ated in the acceptance are not at \\nvariance with the offer or the tender  and that none of the terms of the \\ntender are left out. In case, uncertai n terms are used by the tenderers, \\nclarifications should be obtained befo re such tenders are considered for \\nacceptance. If it is considered that  a counter offer should be made, such \\ncounter offer should be carefully drafted,  as a contract is to take effect on \\nacceptance thereof. If the subject matter of the contract is impossible of \\nfulfillment or is in itself in viol ation of law such contract is void. \\n  \\n6.8 Withdrawal of an Offe r/Proposal and Acceptance  \\n 6.8.1 Withdrawal of an Offer or Proposal\\n: A tenderer firm, which is the \\nproposer, may withdraw its offer at an y time before its acceptance, even \\nthough the firm might have offered to  keep the offer open for a specified \\nperiod. It is equally open to the tenderer to revise or modify his offer. Such \\nwithdrawal, revision or modification  must reach the accepting authority \\nbefore the date and time of opening of tender.  No legal obligations arise \\nout of such withdrawal or revision or modification of t he offer as a simple \\noffer is without a consideration. Wh ere, however, a tenderer agrees to \\nkeep his offer open for a s pecified period for a cons ideration, such offers \\ncannot be withdrawn before the expiry of  the specified date. This would be \\nso where earnest money is deposited by  the tenderer in consideration of \\nhis being supplied the subsidiary cont ract and withdrawal of offer by the \\ntenderer before the specified period wo uld entitle the purchaser to forfeit \\nthe earnest money. \\n \\n ', metadata={'source': 'documents/documents/documents/DPM2009.pdf', 'page': 65}),\n",

All defence contracts are in the \\nname and on behalf of the President of  India. However, the contract, after \\ndue approval of the CFA, may be signed by a staff officer, duly authorized \\nby the CFA in writing. The specimen si gnature of such staff officer is to be \\nsent to all concerned, including the paying and inspecting authorities. As \\nfor the contractor, the person signing th e contract is deemed to have been \\nauthorized by the supplier. \\n \\n6.9.2  Acceptance of the Defence Contracts :  Any contract , when not signed \\nby both parties, namely the purchas er and the supplier, is deemed to \\ncome into force with the acceptance of  the tender as per mutually agreed \\nterms and conditions contained in the RFP and the firm’s offer. However, \\nin the case of supply orders, the fi rm should check the supply order and \\nconvey acceptance of the same within se ven days of receipt of the supply \\norder. If such an acceptance or com munication conveying their objection \\nto certain parts of the contract is not received within the stipulated period, \\nthe supply order is deemed to have been fully accepted by the firm. In \\ncase of foreign contract, normally both parties sign the document thus \\nconveying their acceptance of the contract. \\n \\n6.9.3 Stamping of Defence Contracts : Under entry 5 of Sch edule I of the Indian \\nStamp Act, an agreement or memorand um of agreement for or relating to \\nthe sale of goods or merchandise ex clusively is exempt from payment of \\nstamp duty.  \\n \\n6.10 Types of Contract and Ge neral Principles for Contracting  \\n 6.10.1 Types of Contracts\\n: Government contracts can be of many types \\ndepending on the nature of the item be ing procured, work to be executed, \\nservices required to be rendered and support to be provided.

Balance 5% is released after the stores have been \\nproperly checked and accounted for.  Some suppliers prefer 100% \\npayment after delivery and accounting, which may be accepted. In many \\ncases, suppliers reque st for allowing part supply and corresponding  part \\npayment.

One of the ways to \\nensure this is to conclude Rate Contra cts for all common user items which \\nare regularly required in bulk by the users and whose prices are likely to \\nbe stable and not subject to considerable market fluctuations. A Rate \\nContract (RC) enables procurement officers to procure indented items promptly and with economy of scal e and also cuts down the order \\nprocessing and inventory carrying cost.  The RC system takes care of supply chain management and enables an efficient transaction both for \\nthe purchaser and the\\n supplier. \\n \\n8.1.2 Definition : A Rate Contract (commonly known as RC) is an agreement \\nbetween the purchaser and the supplier for supply of specified goods (and \\nallied services if any) at specifie d price and terms & conditions (as \\nincorporated in the agreement) duri ng the period covered by the Rate \\nContract. No quantity is mentioned no r is any minimum drawal guaranteed \\nin the Rate Contract. The Rate Contract is in the nature of a standing offer \\nfrom the supplier firm. The firm and/ or the purchaser is/are entitled to \\nwithdraw/cancel the Rate Contract by  serving an appropriate notice on \\neach other, of not less than thirty da ys. However, once a supply order is \\nplaced on the supplier for supply of a definite quantity in terms of the rate \\ncontract during the validit y period of the rate contract that supply order \\nbecomes a valid and binding contract and the supplier is bound to supply \\nthe ordered quantity.  \\n8.1.3 Price Agreement\\n: While procuring goods and services, it may be \\nexpedient to enter into a Price Agre ement (PA)/Fixed Price Quotation \\n(FPQ) with the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). The PA/FPQ \\nmay be finalized after due negotiatio n and market survey.  Such PA/FPQ \\nmay be normally valid for a period up to three years and may be extended \\nfurther suitably with next  higher CFA’s sanction.  \\n \\n8.1.4  Types of Items Suitable for RC:  The types of items which may  be \\nconsidered for RC are: \\n \\n(a) Items required by several users on recurring basis and having clear \\nspecifications.   \\n \\n(b) Fast moving items with short sh elf life or storage constraints.

The following aspects \\nshould normally be kept in mind:  \\n \\n(a) No new RC should be placed with  firms having backlog, which is \\nlikely to continue for ma jor portion of the year. \\n (b) Performance of the contractor fo r the last 3 years should be taken \\ninto consideration. \\n \\n(c) If the contractor does not have  current RC, performance against \\nearlier two immediate rate cont racts should be considered.  \\n \\n(d) If the RC holder is a defaulter in  furnishing drawal report, this \\nshould be looked into, if the defaulter is bidding. \\n \\n(e) The minimum performance level / performance criteria should be \\nspecified in the bid documents. \\n 8.5.3  Price Negotiation\\n: While concluding RC, it is preferable to conduct price \\nnegotiations by the CNC in order to obtain best value for money and also \\nto clarify all aspects of the RC to avoid ambiguity and dispute at a later \\nstage. All Rate Contracts and Pric e Agreements should be processed \\nthrough the committee CFA or the CNC  so as to ensure best value for \\nmoney, quality assurance and transparency. Participation of finance \\nmember in all deliberat ions, particularly regarding the pricing and \\nconditions of contract, is mandatory.   \\n8.5.4  Signing of Rate Contract\\n:  RC concluded for various wings of the MOD \\nwill be signed for and on beha lf of the President of India.

The CFA, based on the merit of each case, may  decide the \\nnumber of firms to be awarded RC for an item so that DDOs will have a \\nwider choice. Effort s should be made to co nclude parallel RC s with firms \\nlocated in different parts of the country to cater to  users over a wider \\ngeographical spread. Parallel RC may be  concluded with marginal price \\ndifference say up to 5%. In such case s approval of the next higher CFA is \\nto be taken.   \\n   8.6.2  All DDOs to operate the RCs\\n: Orders against a Rate Contract concluded \\nby any authority may be placed on the same terms and conditions by all \\nDirect Demanding Officers of Services/ Departments/ \\nOrganizations/Units/Establishments under the Ministry of Defence, subject \\nto there being no downward trend in pric es.   To facilitate such operation, \\na suitable provision should be made in the RCs and the details of the RCs \\nposted on the website of the Se rvice/Organization concerned. \\n \\nSpecial Conditions Applicable for Rate Contract  \\n \\n8.7.1  Special Conditions : Some conditions of rate contract differ from the usual \\nconditions applicable for other contra cts. Some such important special \\nconditions of rate contract are as follows: \\n \\ni) Earnest Money Deposit (EMD) is not applicable. \\n ii) In the Schedule of Requirement, no quantity is mentioned; only the \\nanticipated drawal may be ment ioned without any commitment. \\n \\niii) The purchaser reserves the righ t to conclude more than one rate \\ncontract for the same item.  \\niv) The purchaser as well as the supp lier may withdraw the rate contract \\nby serving suitable notice to each ot her. The prescribed notice period is \\ngenerally thirty days. \\n \\nv) The purchaser has the option to renegotiate the price with the rate \\ncontract holders. vi) In case of emergency, the pu rchaser may purchase the same item \\nthrough ad hoc contract with a new supplier.

              " Document(page_content='  83  \\nvii) Usually, the terms of delivery in  rate contracts are FOR dispatching \\nstation. This is so, because the rate co ntracts are to take care of the users \\nspread all over the country . However, wherever it is decided to enter into \\nRCs which are FOR destination, the cost of transportation should be \\nseparately asked for.  viii) Supply orders, incorporating defi nite quantity of goods to be supplied \\nalong with all other required conditions  following the rate contract terms, \\nare to be issued for obtain ing supplies through the rate\\n contract. \\n ix) The purchaser and the authorized user s of the rate contract are entitled \\nto place supply orders upto the last da y of the validity of the rate contract \\nand, though supplies against such suppl y orders will be effected beyond \\nthe validity period of the rate contra ct, all such supplies will be guided by \\nthe terms and conditions of the rate contract.  \\nx) The rate contract will be guided by “Fall Clause”\\n. \\n \\n8.7.2  Fall Clause : Fall clause is a price safety mechanism in rate contracts. The \\nfall clause provides that if the rate co ntract holder reduces its price or sells \\nor even offers to sell the rate contra cted goods following conditions of sale \\nsimilar to those of the rate contract, at a price lower than the rate contract \\nprice, to any person or organization during the currency of the rate contract, the rate contract price will be automatically reduced with effect \\nfrom that date for all the subsequent su pplies under the rate contract and \\nthe rate contract amended accordingl y. Other parallel rate contract \\nholders, if any, are also to be given opportunity to reduce their price as \\nwell, by notifying the reduced price to them and giving them 15 (fifteen) \\ndays’ time to intimate their revised prices , if they so desire, in sealed cover \\nto be opened in public on the spec ified date and time and further action \\ntaken as per standard practice. On many occasions, the parallel rate \\ncontract holders attempt to grab  more orders by unethical means by \\nannouncing reduction of their price (a fter getting the rate contract) under \\nthe guise of Fall Clause. This situation is also to be dealt with in similar \\nmanner as mentioned earlier in th is paragraph. It is, however, very \\nnecessary that the purchase organi zations keep special watch on the \\nperformance of such rate contract holders who reduce their prices on one \\npretext or other. If their performances  are not upto the mark, appropriately \\nsevere action should be taken agains t them including deregistering them, \\nsuspending business deals with th em, terminating the contract, etc. \\n  \\n8.7.3 Performance Security\\n: Depending on the antici pated overall drawal \\nagainst a rate contract and, also, anticipated number of parallel rate \\ncontracts to be issued for an item,  the authority concluding the Rate \\nContract(s) may consider obtaining performance security of reasonable ', metadata={'source': 'documents/documents/documents/DPM2009.pdf', 'page': 90}),\n",

Performance Security \\nshall, however, not be demanded in t he supply orders issued against rate \\ncontracts.  \\n  \\n8.8 Renewal, Extension, Termination  and Revocation of Contracts  \\n \\n8.8.1  Renewal and Extension : It should be ensured that new rate contracts are \\nmade operative right after the expiry of the existing rate contracts without \\nany gap for all rate contracted items. In case, however, it is not possible to \\nconclude new rate contracts due to  some special reasons, timely steps \\nare to be taken to extend the existi ng rate contracts with same terms, \\nconditions etc. for a suitable period, with the consent of the rate contract \\nholders. Rate contracts of the firms, wh ich do not agree to such extension, \\nare to be left out of consideration for renewal and extension. Period of \\nsuch extension should generally not be more than three months. Also, \\nwhile extending the existing rate cont racts, it shall be ensured that the \\nprice trend is not lower. \\n  \\n8.8.2  Termination and Revocation of RC :  RC is in the nature of standing offer \\nand a legal contract comes into being only when a supply order is placed \\nby the CFA/Direct Demanding Officers . Being just a standing offer, \\nembodying various terms of the offer, th e contract holder may revoke it at \\nany time during its currency.

Due to this fa ct, both the Buyer and the Seller, need \\nsome conditions to be fulfilled, to su it their requirements,  before releasing \\nthe payments and goods respectively .

Therefore, such  a type of letter of credit does not \\ngive complete sense of security to th e beneficiary. However, the notice of \\namendment or cancellation is effective only upon receipt of such notice by \\nthe advising bank.  If th e advising bank has underta ken liability (i.e. paid, \\nnegotiated or accepted) against documen ts, which appear on the face of it \\nto be in conformity with the terms and conditions of the credit, before \\nreceiving notice of amendment/cancella tion, the issuing Bank is bound to \\nreimburse the advising bank.  If the letter  of credit is silent as to whether it \\nis revocable or irrevocable, the cr edit is deemed to be irrevocable. \\n \\n12.3.3 Irrevocable Letter Of Credit : When the issuing Bank gives a definite, \\nabsolute and irrevocable undertaking to  honour its obligations, provided \\nthe beneficiary complies with all the terms and conditions, such a credit is \\nknown as an irrevocable letter of cred it. It means that the letter of credit \\ncannot be amended, cancelled or re voked without the consent of the \\nparties to the letter of credit. This  gives the beneficiary a definite \\nprotection. \\n \\n12.3.4 Confirmed Letter Of Credit : A confirmed letter of cr edit is one in respect \\nof which another Bank in the beneficiary ’s country adds its confirmation at \\nthe request of the issuing Bank.  This  undertaking of the confirming Bank \\nto pay/ negotiate/accept is in additio n to the undertaking  of the issuing \\nbank.  This is an added protection to  t h e  b e n e f i c i a r y .

The bank establishes the \\nLC and intimates the Principal Controll er/ Controller of Defence Accounts \\nconcerned and the contract concluding authority.   \\n \\n12.4.2 Payment Through Letter of Credit:  The letter of credit mechanism \\noperates as follows:   \\n(a) The Buyer requests the issuing bank to open an LC.

It is, therefore, important t hat the rates/cost are worked out in a \\nrealistic, objective and professional manner on the basis of the prevailing \\nmarket rates, last purchase pr ice, economic indices for raw \\nmaterial/labour, other input costs an d assessment based on intrinsic value \\netc. It is equally important  to evaluate the quotations/offers received in \\nresponse to the RFP correctly to se lect the best offer. This Chapter \\ncontains guidelines for assessment of ra tes/cost, evaluation of quotations \\nand determining price reasonability. \\n \\n13.2 Costing of Procurement Proposals  \\n 13.2.1 Need for costing\\n: The first stage at which co sting needs to be done is \\nwhen the proposal is initiated by th e Procuring Agency. It is necessary to \\nwork out the complete cost of a procurement proposal to determine availability of funds to meet the expe cted cash outflow and the level at \\nwhich it would need to be approved. It is, therefore, essential that the cost \\nis assessed realistically and compreh ensively. The entire, all inclusive \\nassessed cost should be the ba sis for determining the CFA. \\n \\n13.2.2 Basis of costing\\n: The cost of a procurement proposal may be assessed \\non the basis of the Last Purchase Price (LPP), Professional Officers’ \\nValuation (POV), Budgetary Quote (BQ)  to be obtained from one or more \\nprospective sellers, Market Survey (M S), or any other method as may be \\nappropriate in the context of a pa rticular purchase proposal. These \\nmethods are not mutually exclusive. The method of costing should be \\nclearly recorded while seeking CFA’s approval. \\n \\n13.2.3 Cost to be worked out in INR : Wherever applicable, the assessed cost \\nshould be converted into the common  denomination of Indian Rupees \\n(INR) and shown both in terms of the foreign currency and INR while \\nseeking CFA’s approval. The exchange rate adopted should be as on the \\ndate of opening of the price bids. The conversion factor should be clearly \\nindicated.

The first step in arriving at the \\ndecision regarding reasonability of pric e or otherwise is to determine the \\nexact cost of the proposal. In order to  ensure that all offers are compared \\nin an equitable and fair manner and the vendors are provided a level \\nplaying field, all elements of cost, in cluding the terms and conditions with \\nfinancial implications are to be take n into account. The criteria to be \\nadopted for this purpose should be  indicated in the RFP and the \\nquotations should be ranked as per th ose criteria. In t he case of medical \\nequipment where five years warranty/gu arantee is provided for, firms may \\nbe asked to quote comprehensive AMC ra tes for five year s on expiry of \\nwarranty/ guarantee and these may be loaded in CST and taken into \\nconsideration while deciding the L 1 vendor. However, this evaluation \\ncriterion would be clearly indicated in the RFP in such cases. \\n \\n13.3.2 Basis of comparison of cost : The basis for comparison of cost in \\ndifferent situations would be as follows: \\n \\n(a) When the competition is only among the Indian Suppliers, the F.O.R \\nPrices at destination (Consignee’s premises) should be the basis for \\nranking of quotations.  \\n \\n(b) If the competition is amongst  foreign suppliers, the basis for \\ncomparison should be the landed price at the destination (designated port) \\nonly. \\n \\n(c) When the competition is amongst in digenous and foreig n suppliers, the \\nbasic cost (CIF) quoted by the forei gn suppliers should be the basis for \\ncomparison with the basic cost offere d by the indigenous suppliers, after \\noffloading the Excise Duty (ED), Ce ntral Sales Tax/VAT and other local \\ntaxes and levies. The term ‘indigen ous supplier’ woul d include Defence \\nPSUs and the Indian Ordnance Factories (OFs). \\n 13.3.3 Determining CIF cost\\n: When the quotations of foreign vendors are also \\nto be compared with the quotation of  indigenous suppliers, CIF cost of \\nforeign supplier is to be taken into account but difficulty arises when only FOB/FCA cost is indicated by a fore ign supplier. There cannot be any \\nstandard formula for arriving at the CI F value in such cases. It would not \\nbe desirable to add a notional additiona l cost as a percentage of FOB/FCA \\ncost to arrive at the CIF cost. To avoi d a situation like th is, it should be \\nclearly indicated in the RFP that the foreign vendors shou ld indicate the \\nCIF cost.

The pr ices quoted in foreign currencies \\nshould be converted into  INR indicated in the CS T. The rate of conversion \\nof foreign currency into INR prevailing on the date of opening of the price \\nbid may be taken into account for co nverting the quoted price into INR. \\nThe rate can be obtained from SBI Parliament Street, New Delhi. The CST \\nshould be exhaustive and it must include all details given in the \\nquotations.  Any deviation from the te nder documents is to be brought out \\nin the CST.

However, it would be \\nthe CNC only which will finally dete rmine the lowest acceptable offer (L 1 \\nvendor).  \\n \\n   \\n13.3.6  Negotiations and benchmarking : In multi-vendor cases, on opening of \\ncommercial offers, once L 1 vendor is identified, the contract should be \\nconcluded with him and there woul d be no need for any further price \\nnegotiations.  However, negotiati ons can be held in exceptional \\ncircumstances where valid logical re asons exist and such negotiations \\nshould be held only with L 1.  The exceptional situations include \\nprocurement of proprietary items, item s with limited sources of supply and \\nitems where there is suspicion of cart el formation.

However, such LPP could be used as an input for assessing \\nthe rates by adding yearly escalation, if considered necessary.

This escalation factor  should be carefully worked out on \\nthe basis of data of past  purchases of the same/similar items or as per the \\nPricing Policy Agreements, if any. T he escalation factor should be worked \\nout by Procuring Agencies of the Se rvices after mutual consultation so \\nthat different escalation factors are not applied by different Procuring \\nAgencies for the same/ similar items and  in respect of the same source or \\nshould be worked out as per pricing policy where such pricing IGA is in \\nplace. \\n \\n(b) LPP should pertain to  a past successfully executed order of similar \\nmagnitude and scope of supply.  \\n(c) Factors like basket price and bulk  discount offered need to be taken \\nin to account while using LPP as  a scale for comparing prices. \\n \\n(d) Price variation clause, if any, and the final cost paid by the user in \\nrespect of last purchase to which LP P pertains needs to be considered. \\n (e) Factors like items supplied agai nst LPP being of current production \\nor ex-stock supply need to be taken into account.  \\n(f) Market conditions and other fact ors like re-starting production lines \\ndue to obsolescence may also have to be considered.  \\n(g) Where no other option to assess reasonable rate is feasible, LPP of more than three year vintage may al so be taken into account but such \\nsituations should be rare.  \\n13.6 Adoption of Discounted Cash Flow Technique (DCF) \\n \\n \\n13.6.1 Discounted Cash Flow : The Discounted Cash Flow is defined in the \\nGlossary of Management Accountin g Terms, published by the I nstitute of \\nCost and Works Accountants of India, as  “the method of evaluation by \\nwhich cash flow of the future are di scounted to current levels by the \\napplication of a discount rate with a view to reducing all cash flow to \\ncommon denomination and make comparis on”.

All the surveillance and weapon systems are interlinked and \\nintegrated through an elaborate da ta management system. The platform \\nas a whole or a part thereof is requir ed to be refitted/repaired from time to \\ntime, including inter alia , disassembly, docking,  inspection/survey, \\nrepair/overhaul followed by trials in harbour and at s ea. As an integral part \\nof the refit process, approved mod ifications to st ructure, equipment, \\nmachinery and systems incl uding installation of new equipment are also \\ncarried out. Overall, the partial /compl ete refit of a ship/submarine/ yard \\ncraft is a complex activity, wherein concerted planning is required much before the commencement of the repairs/ refit and also during the course \\nof the repairs/refit to ensure comp letion in a time bound manner and make \\nthe platform seaworthy and battle worthy . Repair of Marine Assets/Service \\nAssets also involve the same kind of  planning as required for undertaking \\nrepairs/refits of Ships/Submarines. Th e entire activity is different from \\nother revenue procurement activity, su ch as, procurement of goods and \\nstores or even other services, sinc e a number of technical issues are \\nrequired to be addressed, includi ng visits by the bidders to the \\nship/submarine /assets to be repaired/ re fitted.

The SOW in refits of ships/submarines are usually non-\\ndeterministic and dynamic in nature wi th regard to resources required for \\ncompletion. The growth of work, a fe ature typical of re fits/repairs, is \\ndependent inter alia  on factors such as Age of  Ship/Submarine, Condition \\nof onboard Equipment/mach inery, Condition of Hull, role and exploitation \\npattern, duration between formulati on of work package and actual \\nexecution of work, modifications and Additions & Alterations.

Payment in all such cases will be made at actuals subject \\nto the respective ceiling stipulated for the Navy and Coast Guard. A Post \\nRefit Report would be drawn up for di stribution to all concerned including \\nthe IFA.   \\nNote :   In case of Coast Guard, the pr esent practice is to allow a component \\nup to 15% of Contract Value towards Growth of Work and up to 20% of \\nContract Value towards Non-available Sp ares. This practice may continue for \\nthe present.   \\nGrowth of work would be costed on pr o-rata costs quoted by the Bidder and \\naccepted during CNC. Wherever, pro-rata rates are not available, the prices \\nwould be negotiated by the COA in consultation with the IFA. \\n14.8 Payment Terms  \\n14.8.1   Stages of Payment.

Advance on signing of Contract of up \\nto 10% of cost of spares, against Bank Guarantee may be permitted. The remaining payment for spares would be made along \\nwith the stage payments during re fit duration, on submission of \\nproof of Purchase order, Material  receipt and Inward inspection. \\nHandling charges, if any, are to be restricted to a maximum of \\n7.5%.  \\n \\n14.9 Loading in Case of Defect  List Items “Not Quoted”\\n.   In order to ensure \\nthat all offers are compared in an eq uitable and fair manner, loading would \\nbe resorted to for determining the L 1. During this process the bids with \\nunresponsive sections/sub-sections  would be loaded by the amount \\nquoted by the highest bidder for that particular section/sub-section for \\npreparing CST. The Bid shall be deemed to be responsive only if the firm \\naccepts the loading in writing.  \\n14.10  Criterion for Determination of L1 Firm . The L 1 Firm would be \\ndetermined as follows:- \\n(a) Navy .    The Cost of Refit, Services  and Budgetary Cost of Spares \\nlisted in the work package would be taken into account for determination \\nof L 1.  Payment for such mandatory spares  shall not exceed the budgetary \\ncost given in the ‘Q’ bid. \\n(b) Coast Guard .

The \\ngeneral instructions contained herein  have been made as flexible as \\npossible to avoid time delays and to  encourage the industry to come \\nforward and undertake the design, dev elopment and fabrication of items, \\nequipment, plant and machinery requi red by the Defence Services.  \\nDetailed Instructions on Procedures to be followed in-house for processing \\norders for items of a developmental nature/indigenisation may be drawn \\nby the Services HQrs/ other developme nt agencies like DRDO, CPOs etc. \\nin consultation with the MoD (Fi nance) in broad consonance with the \\nguidelines contained herein. \\n \\n15.1.2 Decision for Indigenous Development.  The Technical \\nDirectorate/ Directorate of Indigenisation /Committe e for Indigenisation of \\nthe concerned Service/ Department / Command HQ should assess the \\neconomic viability of indigenous manufa cture of a defence item in the civil \\nsector in terms of vol ume, likelihood of future  requirement and economies \\nof scale, residual life of the equi pment/item and a clear indication of \\nrequirement over a long period (of say 3-5 years). For this purpose \\nnecessary systemic changes in planni ng and provisioning may be carried \\nout by the Services. In case the above conditions are not fulfilled, the \\nfeasibility of indigenising a package  of similar range of items may be \\nconsidered / decided by the CFA in co nsultation with the IFA keeping in \\nview the volume, future requiremen t and economies of scale so as to \\nmake the package commercially viable. If it is not feasible to work out a \\npackage but the item is still requir ed to be indigenised for strategic \\nreasons, the requirement may be projec ted to the Department of Defence \\nProduction and Supplies for development by the OFB/Defence PSUs etc.  where feasible.   \\n \\n15.1.3  Partnership with Private Sector\\n. The Indian private sector \\nIndustry today offers scope for thei r greater involvement in the Defence \\nSector and possesses the requisit e skills and infrastructure for \\nundertaking defence production or may be willing to invest/share the cost \\nof setting up of such infrastructure.

In case of higher \\ndeviation the full / Economic Or der Quantity (EOQ) order may be \\nplaced on the L 1 firm, subject to price being found reasonable.   \\n \\n(d) Placing of parallel contracts on two parties is particularly \\nnecessary/desirable to have more than one source of supply at bulk \\nproduction stage and also, apar t from competition, to ensure \\nsuccessful completion of developmen t if one of the contractors fails \\nto develop the equipment in time.    \\n \\n(e)   The ratio of splitting of the supply order between various \\ndevelopment agencies/firms in cases of parallel development, \\nincluding criteria thereof, must be  pre-disclosed in the RFP itself.   \\n (f)    However, in case the requirement is meager and complex \\ntechnology is involved, a single source having expertise in the \\nrequisite field may be considered wi th appropriate ju stification and \\ndue approval of the CFA in consul tation with IFA where required as \\nper delegation of financial powers. \\n  ', metadata={'source': 'documents/documents/documents/DPM2009.pdf', 'page': 150}),\n",

Wh erever possible, the vendors who \\nare registered with DGAQA/D GQA/DRDO/OFs/ DPSUs/Services \\nindigenisation agencies/ NSIC should  be approached. Suitable vendors \\ncan also be identified by the develo ping agency in consultation with other \\ndeveloping agencies apart from firms regi stered with DGQA or any other \\ndefence establishment. Unregistered fi rms may be considered taking into \\naccount their infrastructural facilities, capacity, technical competence and \\nfinancial standing. A format for this purpose is enclosed at Form                  \\nDPM - 5.  Firms of national repute  may also be considered based on self-\\ncertification, with the approval  of the Defence Secretary. \\n \\n15.4.2   Development of Source by Invi ting Applications for Enlistment .    \\n \\nThe following procedure will be followed:- \\n \\na) Open advertisement will be  placed on the internet and \\nadvertised in leading newspapers ever y year, in respect of different \\nproducts/components, fo r enlisting firms willing to participate in \\ntenders issued by the Departmen t/Organisation.  The minimum \\nnumber of products/components required to be submitted by the vendor for evaluation and likely demand for those products/components for the next  two to three years will be \\nindicated in the advertisement. \\n b) Interested firms may visit the factory/workshop/depot as \\nindicated in the tender to see th e product/ component required to \\nbe developed.  Thereafter, the firm s showing interest in developing \\nthe product/component should be aske d to submit the details of \\ninfrastructure available with them , as per the documents prescribed \\nfor vendor registration;  \\nc) The infrastructure details submitted by the firms should be studied by a team of officers  constituted to assess their \\nmanufacturing capability to veri fy their genuine potential for \\ndeveloping the product/ component. \\n ', metadata={'source': 'documents/documents/documents/DPM2009.pdf', 'page': 153}),\n",

On acceptance of samples, \\nthe firm will be eligible for parti cipating in the LTEs for the said \\ncomponent / product. \\n \\ne) A firm may not be willin g to submit a sample due to \\nrequirement of a heavy investment. In such cases, the indigenisation agency / Director ate may place a development order \\non the firm as follows :- \\n \\n (i) The cost of the sampl e will be assessed through a \\nBoard of Officers having representation from Finance. \\n \\n (ii) The firm will be asked to offer a quotation and if the \\nprice is found to be equal to or lower than the assessed cost, \\nthe development order will be pl aced on the firm at the price \\nquoted. \\n \\n (iii) If the firm quotes a price higher than the assessed \\ncost, the price will be nego tiated with the firm and \\ndevelopment order placed at the assessed cost. \\n \\n15.4.3   Capacity Assessment\\n. Capacity assessment/verification of firms not \\nregistered with DGQA/DGNAI/DGAQA/G ovt Agencies is to be undertaken \\nby the developing agency by associating a member from the DGQA/DGNAI/DGAQA, other inspection agencies or other Technical Agencies/Committees on fast track to ensure that firms identified are \\ncapable to develop prototype equipmen t and systems as required. Where \\nconsidered necessary by the CFA, IFA may be associated for assessment \\nof the financial capacity of the firm. On ce a firm has successfully executed \\nan order within +/-5% tolerance both in terms of quality and quantity, it should be encouraged to get registered.  \\n \\n15.4.4  Transfer of Technology (ToT)\\n.   When equipment is  being bought from \\na foreign vendor, the provision of ToT to an Indian private/public firm for \\nproviding maintenance infrastructure may be considered and the foreign \\nvendor would need to identify an Indian  firm which would be responsible \\nfor providing base repairs (third line) and the requisite spares for the entire \\nlife cycle of the equipment. These fi rms would be DPSUs/OFB/RURs/or \\nany other firm specially selected for this purpose. In addition Army Base \\nWorkshops/Naval Dockyards/Base Repa ir Depots of Air Force may also \\nbe considered for this purpose at RF P stage on a case to case basis in \\nconsultation with the DDP. The RFP would spell out the specific \\nrequirements of ToT for Maintenance In frastructure which could cover the \\nproduction of certain spar es, establishment of ba se repair facilities \\nincluding testing facilities and the prov ision of spares for the entire life ', metadata={'source': 'documents/documents/documents/DPM2009.pdf', 'page': 154}),\n",

Development/ indigenisation of an item \\nmay require design, generation of drawings, manufacturing, development \\nof prototype equipment and system,  quality assurance during \\ndevelopment process, tests and trials and inspections at various stages.  \\nRFP is to be floated to firms who have  the required infrastructure for the \\nproposed development. In order to sa ve on development time and in case \\nof the classified nature of stores to be developed,  quotations may normally \\nbe invited on limited tender basis fr om firms/contractors who are known to \\nbe capable of undertaking the particul ar development work.  However, \\ndepending upon the specific requir ements of the case, the developing \\nagency may justify issue of RFP either  on OTE, LTE or STE basis, as \\nrequired. \\n \\n15.5.2  Pre-bid Conference .   In case of turnkey co ntracts or for development of \\nsophisticated and comple x equipment, a suitable provision is to be made \\nin the bidding documents for a pre-bid conference for clarifying issues and \\nclearing doubts, if any, about the spec ification and other technical details \\nof the plant, machinery and equipment projected in the bidding document.  \\nThe date, time and place of the Pre-bi d Conference must be indicated in \\nthe bidding document and should be su fficiently ahead of the bid opening \\ndate. \\n \\n15.6 Receipt and Evaluation of Bids  \\n \\n15.6.1    Bid Opening/Technical Evaluation and CNC . The firms submitting \\ntheir quotation will be intimated the place, date and time for opening of the \\nquotation and the bids will be opened at the appointed time by the Board \\nof Officers in the presence of the re presentatives of the firm, if present. \\nThe procedure for tender opening, te chnical evaluation, preparation of \\nCST and convening of TPC/CNC for co mmercial evaluation thereof will be \\nas per modality given elsewhere in t he relevant Chapters of this DPM.  \\n \\n15.6.2   Resultant Single Vendor Situation . In case of LTE/Open Tender \\ninvitation if only one firm responds or if only one firm is found by the TEC \\nto meet all the specifications, the following aspects will be examined:- \\n \\n(a) Whether all necessary requ irements such as Standard \\nTender Enquiry conditions, wide publicity, and sufficient time for \\nformulation of tenders had been taken care of while issuing the \\nRFP; \\n ', metadata={'source': 'documents/documents/documents/DPM2009.pdf', 'page': 155}),\n",

(d) Whether the price quoted in the bid is considered reasonable.  \\n \\n15.6.3    Examination .\\n If the examination reveals that  requirements from (a) to (d) \\nhave been fulfilled the proposal may be  processed further as a case of \\nOTE/LTE as applicable, with the approv al of the CFA, for placement of the \\ndevelopment order. However, if the quoted price is not borne out as \\nreasonable based on benchmarking prio r to opening of the commercial bid \\nor if the offer is not technically feasib le or firm not considered capable of \\ndeveloping the item, the bid should be  retracted with the approval of the \\nCFA \\n \\n15.6.4    Reasonableness of  Price .  It would be mandatory for the vendor to \\nsubmit the detailed break-up of cost under the headings materials \\n(indigenous/ imported, quantity, cost ), labour (number of man hours, man \\nhour rates, etc.), design and deve lopment, drawings and details of \\noverheads which will be vetted by a technical team of the Department \\n/Organisation. The last purchase pr ice (LPP) of import ed item will be taken \\nas the base price to arrive at the r easonableness of the quoted rates. In \\ncase LPP is not available the base pric e will be arrived at by the process \\nof benchmarking which will be done prior to opening of the Commercial \\nbid as per the procedure given in Chapter 13 of the DPM. L 1 will be \\ndetermined with reference to the deve lopment cost, including the cost of \\nprototype and the total quantity for wh ich the initial orders are placed.

Various types of contracts can be \\nadopted depending upon the nature , complexity and time span of the \\ndevelopment work /project. These are described below. However, normally Firm-Fixed-Price contracts, Fi xed Price Contracts with escalation \\nclause and Fabrication Contracts will be concluded.  Contracts other than these three will be adopted only with the prior approval of Service \\nHeadquarters/ Head of Organisati on /Department /Service / HQ \\nMaintenance Command IAF in consultati on with the respective IFA.   \\n \\n \\n ', metadata={'source': 'documents/documents/documents/DPM2009.pdf', 'page': 156}),\n",
              " Document(page_content='  15015.7.2   Firm-Fixed-Price Contract . Firm fixed price contract means a \\ncontract in which a lump s um amount is agreed upon for \\ndevelopment/indigenisation and supp ly of the equipment based on \\ndata/specifications supplied and whic h is not subject to any adjustment \\nduring the performance of the contract  due to any reasons whatsoever.  \\nThe firm or the contractor assumes fu ll financial responsibility in the form \\nof profit or loss.  Th is type of contract is best suited when reasonably \\ndefinite design or performance spec ification is available and when \\nGovernment can estimate reasonable pric e of development/indigenisation.   \\n \\n15.7.3   Fixed Price Contract with Escalation . This is the same as the firm-\\nfixed-price contract, except that upward or downward revision of \\ncontracted price can be allowed on oc currence of certain contingencies \\nbeyond the control of the firm/contrac tor such as increase/decrease in \\nwages or cost of material.  An escala tion formula must be included in such \\ncontracts and a ceiling of escalation sh ould also be fixed in the case of \\nlong term contracts. Price variation clause can be provided only in long \\nterm contracts where the delivery pe riod extends beyond 18 months. The \\nconditions prescribed for price variat ion clause elsewhere in the DPM will \\napply whenever such a clause is incl uded in the developme ntal contracts. \\n \\n15.7.4 Fixed Price Contract providing for Re-determination of Price . This \\ntype of contract is intend ed to eliminate the impact of contingencies due to \\ncauses other than those foreseen in th e case of fixed price contract with \\nescalation.  These contingencies may be due to the contractor’s/firm’s \\nunfamiliarity with the raw materials or  manufacturing processes, to long \\nterm contracts, lack of specifications or the use of perform ance rather than \\nproduct specifications.  In such case s prospective re-determination could \\nbe done -    \\n(i) On request by either party \\n (ii) At stated intervals \\n (iii) At a determinable time. \\n \\n15.7.5 Fixed Price Incentive Contract\\n. This type of cont ract is designed to \\nprovide a greater incentive to the firm  / contractor to reduce the contract \\ncosts by providing higher profits if  costs are reduced and lower profits \\nwhen costs rise.  These costs, the cei lings on target cost, target profit, a \\nprice ceiling and the formul a for arriving at final co st are all settled before \\nthe execution of the contract.  This cont ract type will only be applicable for \\nab-initio development contracts. \\n \\n15.7.6 Cost Plus Contract . Cost Plus contracts should  ordinarily be avoided. \\nWhere such contracts become unavoid able as no vendor is willing to \\nundertake the development, full justification should be recorded before ', metadata={'source': 'documents/documents/documents/DPM2009.pdf', 'page': 157}),\n",

In this ty pe of contract the firm/contractor is \\nreimbursed the costs incurred and also  receives a negotiated profit for \\nperforming the contract, i.e., the prof it of the firm/contractor and not the \\ncost of development is fixed.  Contra ctor’s responsibility towards cost of \\nthe item is minimum except that he  has to use the same care and \\nprudence as is expected under fixed price c ontracts.  This type of contract \\nshould be concluded only when the unce rtainty which is involved in the \\ncontract performance is of such a magn itude that the cost of performance \\ncannot be estimated with sufficient r easonableness to permit the type of \\nfixed price contract. It is also necessary to ascertain that the \\nfirms/contractors have cost account ing machinery and th at the cost is \\nclearly defined.  A strict R&D surveill ance has got to be provided by the \\nDept to ensure that costs incurred by  the firm are reduced to the minimum. \\nThe RFP should provide for the firm’s books of accounts to be checked by \\nthe Order Placing Agency to verify the costs by inclusion of a book \\nexamination clause as per standard format. Where supplies or works have to continue over a long duration, ef forts should be made to convert future \\ncontracts on a firm price basis, afte r allowing a reasonable period to the \\nsupplier/contractor to stabilise their production methods. \\n 15.7.7  Fabrication Contract\\n. Fabrication contract means a one time contract \\nconcluded with a contractor or a fi rm for fabrication and supply of \\ncomponent, sub-assemblies or an asse mbly, which are not commercially \\navailable, against design drawings/spe cifications to be supplied by the \\nDirectorate of Indigenisation/R&D  Laboratory/Establishment/Workshop/ \\nDepot /Institution.  \\n \\n15.8   Conclusion of Development Contracts  \\n 15.8.1  Conditions for placing Development Contracts\\n.

The \\ntwo bid system should be followed in design/development/fabrication cont racts of a complex nature. In \\nother cases, a single bid may be invited.  A Pre bid conference may \\nbe held prior to submission of th e tenders to clarify any doubtful \\nareas and also to firm up the SQ Rs/QRs prior to submission of \\nbids.   \\n(b)   When the statement of case for sanctioning of various phases \\nof the project or the indent is  put up, the Head of Service or \\nEstablishment /Director/Purchase Dept concerned should mention the amount that is intended to be spent on development/fabrication \\ncontracts out of the total cost of the project.

Since the \\nmanufacturing drawings are evolved an d finalised by the contractor who \\nhas initially developed the item, it is likely that the contractor would claim \\nhis rights on such drawings and not ag ree to part with them.

The Bidders are required to spell out  the rates of Customs duty, Excise \\nduty, VAT, Service Tax, etc in unambi guous terms; otherwise their offers \\nwill be loaded with the maximum rates of duties and taxes for the purpose \\nof comparison of prices. If reimbursem ent of Customs duty / Excise Duty / \\nVAT is intended as extra, over the quoted prices, the Bidder must \\nspecifically say so.

If a \\nBidder chooses to quote a price incl usive of any duty and does not \\nconfirm inclusive of such duty so in cluded is firm and final, he should \\nclearly indicate the rate of such duty and quantum of excise duty included \\nin the price.  Failure to do so may  result in ignoring of such offers \\nsummarily. If a Bidder is exempted  from payment of Customs duty / \\nExcise Duty / VAT duty upto any value of supplies from them, they should \\nclearly state that no excise duty will be charged by them up to the limit of \\nexemption which they may have.   If any concession is available in regard \\nto rate/quantum of Customs duty / E xcise Duty / VAT, it should be \\nbrought out clearly.  Stipulations like, excise duty was presently not \\napplicable but the same will be char ged if it becomes le viable later on, \\nwill not be accepted unless in such ca ses it is clearly stated by a Bidder \\nthat excise duty will not be char ged by him even if the same becomes \\napplicable later on.  In respect of the Bidders who fail to comply with this \\nrequirement, their quoted prices sh all be loaded with the quantum of \\nexcise duty which is normally applicab le on the item in question for the \\npurpose of comparing their prices with other Bidders. The same logic applies to Customs duty and VAT also. \\n \\ne. In import cases, all the foreign quotes will be brought to a common \\ndenomination in Indian Rupees by adopting the exchange rate as BC \\nSelling rate of the State Bank of India on the date  of the opening of Price \\nBids.  \\n \\nf.   If there is a discrepancy between th e unit price and the total price that is \\nobtained by multiplying the unit price and quantity, the unit price will \\nprevail and the total price will be co rrected.
