INTRODUCTION 
   
 1.1 Short Title and Commencement 
1.1.1 This Manual may be called the Defence Procurement Manual, 2009   
(DPM 2009, for short).  
 
1.1.2 This Manual contains principles and procedure relating to procurement of 
goods and services for the Defence Services, Organizations and 
Establishments, laid down in terms of Rule 135 of the General Financial 
Rules, 2005 and shall come into force with effect from 1st of April 2009. 
 
1.1.3 All on-going cases of procurement in which Request for Proposal (RFP) 
has already been issued may continue to be regulated by the provisions of 
the Defence Procurement Manual, 2006.   
 
 1.2 Applicability 
1.2.1 The principles and procedures contained in this Manual are to be followed 
by all wings of the Ministry of Defence and the Defence Services, as well 
as all organizations and units/establishments thereunder, for procurement 
of goods and services, expenditure on account of which is met from the 
revenue heads of the Defence Services Estimates (DSE) and any other 
type of purchases to which the provisions are made specifically applicable.  
 
1.2.2 The procedure laid down in this Manual shall also be applicable to the 
following: 
 
(a)  the Coast Guard Organization and Jammu & Kashmir Light Infantry 
(JAKLI) for procurement under the revenue heads for which budgetary 
allocation is made in the Demand for Grant of the Ministry of Defence 
(Civil); 
 
(b) procurement of certain capital items, as notified by the Ministry of 
Defence from time to time;  
 
(c) procurement of medical equipment, both under revenue and capital 
heads; and 
 
(d) purchases made by the Defence Services from grants placed at their 
disposal by other Ministries/Departments like the Ministry of Home 
Affairs, Ministry of Environment and Forests, etc. 
 
  
2 
 
1.2.3 The procedure laid down in this Manual shall be followed for central 
procurement as well as local purchases under delegated financial powers 
of authorities in the Ministry of Defence, Service Headquarters and all 
subordinate authorities in the Command Headquarters, lower formations, 
establishments and units thereunder at all levels. 
 
 1.3 Scope 
1.3.1  The term procurement means acquiring all types of goods (both scaled 
and non-scaled), such as equipment, stores, spares, technical literature, 
etc., as well as all types of services, including packing, unpacking, 
preservation, transportation, insurance, delivery, special services, leasing, 
technical assessment, consultancy, systems study, software development, 
maintenance, updates, conservancy, etc.  
 
 1.4 Definitions 
1.4.1 Unless the context requires otherwise, the terms used in this Manual will 
have the meaning as described herein below. 
 
1.4.2 Authority Holding Sealed Particulars (AHSP): AHSP is the authority 
responsible for collecting, collating, developing, amending, updating, 
holding and supplying sealed particulars of the defence items in 
accordance with the laid down procedure. AHSP may be the Director 
General of Quality Assurance (DGQA) or an authority in the Service 
Headquarters for service specific items. Similar responsibility for the Naval 
and Air Force equipments rests with respective service headquarters. 
Ordnance Factories are the AHSP for certain types of ‘B’ vehicles and 
items issued to indentors, other than the defence services. DGAQA is the 
AHSP for aviation stores of all the Services and the Coast Guard. 
Procurement officers, the suppliers and the Inspection Agencies are 
  required to comply with the specifications drawn up by the AHSP.  
1.4.3 Competent Financial Authority:  The Competent Financial Authority 
(CFA) is an authority duly empowered by the Government of India to 
sanction and approve expenditure from public accounts upto a specified 
limit in terms of amount of such expenditure and subject to availability of 
funds. All financial powers are to be exercised by the appropriate CFA. 
Where financial powers have been delegated to more than one authority 
under the same Serial/Head, authority with higher delegated financial 
powers will constitute the ‘next higher CFA’. 
 
1.4.4  Contract: A proposal or offer when accepted is a promise, a promise and 
every set of promises forming the consideration for each other is an 
agreement and an agreement, if made with free consent of parties 
  
3 
competent to contract, for a lawful consideration and with a lawful object, 
is a contract. 
  
1.4.5 Direct 
Demanding 
Officers: 
The 
authorities 
in 
the 
Services/ 
Departments/establishments/units/hospitals etc. who have been duly 
authorized to place purchase orders directly on the rate contract holding 
firms/suppliers with whom Rate Contracts have been concluded by the 
central purchase organizations for the particular items/goods.  
 
1.4.6  Financial Power: Financial power is the power to approve expenditure to 
be incurred for bonafide purposes in accordance with the laid down 
procedure and subject to availability of funds. The powers delegated by 
the Ministry of Defence to various authorities in the Services Headquarters 
and other organizations/establishments under them, as also to authorities 
in other organizations under the Ministry of Defence, are personal and 
cannot be further sub-delegated to any subordinate authority by the 
delegatee. However, on the strict understanding that the sole 
responsibility rests on them, the authorities to which financial powers have 
been delegated may authorize staff officer(s) to sign communications and 
financial documents on their behalf provided that the name of the officer 
who is authorized to sign is communicated to the Audit Officer concerned.   
 
 
1.4.7 GSQRs/JSQRs/NSQR/AFSQR: 
The 
General 
Staff 
Qualitative 
Requirements which lay down the technical parameters of the 
equipment/item required by the Service (Army), reflecting the user’s 
requirements in terms of functional characteristics of the stores being 
procured. These also generally need to indicate the requirement of military 
grade, ruggedized or commercially off the shelf items. NSQRs and 
AFSQRs refer to the Naval and Air Force Staff Qualitative Requirements 
respectively for equipment specific to these Services. JSQRs refer to 
specifications reflecting the Joint Services Qualitative Requirements in 
cases where commonality of equipment exists and standardization of QRs 
between the three Services is merited. 
 
1.4.8  Indent:  An indent is a requisition placed by the provisioning authority on 
the procurement agency to procure an item. Indent is the authority for 
initiating procurement action and may contain one or more items, each 
with a distinct item code/part number. All necessary details of the item, 
including quantity, denomination, estimated price, specification, scope of 
supply, date by which required and inspection authority are to be indicated 
in the indent to enable prompt procurement of the item.  
 
1.4.9  Indenting Agency: The indenting agency is a logistic entity that places 
the requirement of stores in the form of an indent on a procurement 
agency to meet the requirement of stores based on periodic reviews or 
urgent unforeseen requirements. Normally, the indenting agency is a store 
  
4 
holding agency and the indentor is the person authorised to raise indents 
on behalf of the indenting agency.   
 
1.4.10  Inspecting Authority: Normally, AHSP is designated as the Inspecting 
Authority. This can be DGQA/DGAQA/DGNAI for defence related items, 
AHSP in Service Headquarters for specified category of items and the 
ADG(QA) in DGS&D for general items procured by them. The Inspecting 
Authority is to promulgate inspection methodology and nominate suitable 
inspection agency for specific contracts.  
 
1.4.11 Inspecting Agency: The Inspecting Authority nominates the Inspecting 
Agency and the Inspecting officer based on the type of items and 
geographical location of the purchaser and supplier. The Inspecting officer 
need not necessarily be from the organization of the Inspecting Authority.  
 
1.4.12 Integrated Finance: While Finance Division of the Ministry of Defence 
functions as Integrated Finance for CFAs in the Ministry, officers 
designated as Integrated Financial Advisors (IFAs) constitute integrated 
finance for the CFAs in the Services Headquarters, ISOs, Command 
Headquarters, lower formations and units thereunder. The term ‘IFA’ used 
in this Manual includes the Finance Division and vice versa. 
 
1.4.13 Not in Vocabulary (NIV): Items which are not in the vocabulary of stores, 
i.e., the items that have not been formally introduced and allotted a unique 
cat part number in the central approved list of inventory items of the 
concerned Service/Organization, as applicable. 
 
1.4.14 Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM):  The original equipment 
manufacturer which is the only firm manufacturing the specified 
item/equipment of a specific make, as distinguished from the 
stockists/distributors or suppliers of such items/equipment and no other 
manufacturer exists for that equipment. 
 
Paying Authority: In respect of procurements made under this Manual, Paying 
Authority means any of the following authorities: 
 
(a) Office of the Principal Controller of Defence Accounts/Controller of 
Defence Accounts under the Controller General of Defence Accounts

of Defence Accounts 
 
(c) An authority holding cash assignment/imprest and duly authorized to 
make payment for procurement 
 
  
5 
1.4.16 Procurement: Procurement refers to the entire gamut of activities 
involved in and the procedures to be adopted for acquiring goods and 
services as defined in paragraph 1.3.1 of this Manual. 
 
1.4.17 Procurement Agency: The Procurement or Procuring Agency is the 
logistic agency that is responsible for the actual procurement as per the 
prescribed procedure to meet the requirement of the indentor. 
 
1.4.18 Purchaser: The President of India acting through the authority issuing the 
purchase/supply 
orders 
or 
signing 
the 
Contracts/Memo 
of 
Understanding/Agreements, is the Purchaser in all cases of procurement 
on behalf of the Government of India. Where the context so warrants, 
other terms, such as the ‘buyer’, have also been used in this Manual. 
 
1.4.19 Rate Contract (RC): A Rate Contract is an agreement between the 
Purchaser and the Supplier to supply stores at specified prices during the 
period covered by the contract. An RC is in the nature of a standing offer 
from the supplier and no minimum drawal need be guaranteed. A contract 
comes into being only when a formal order is placed by the CFA or the 
Direct Demanding Officers (DDOs) on the Supplier.  
 
1.4.20 Stores: The terms ‘Stores’ would include all items mentioned in 
paragraph 1.3.1 of this Manual. 
 
 
1.4.21 Supplier:  Supplier is the entity, which enters into a contract to supply 
goods and services. The term includes employees, agents, assigns, 
successors, authorized dealers, stockists and distributors of such an 
entity. Where the context so warrants, other terms, such as ‘vendor’ or 
‘seller’, have also been used synonymously in this Manual. 
 
1.4.22 Terms and expressions not defined in the Manual: The terms and 
expressions not defined herein shall have the meaning assigned to them, 
if any, in the Indian Sale of Goods Act 1930, the Indian Contract act 1872, 
the General Clauses Act 1897, or other Indian Statuettes and Government 
Instructions, as amended from time to time. 
 
 1.5 Departmental Manuals and Instructions 
1.5.1  Conformity of the Manual with other Government Orders, etc.: The 
provisions contained in this Manual are in conformity with other 
Government manuals like the General Financial Rules, Financial 
Regulations (Defence Services Regulations), as also other instructions 
issued by the Government and the Central Vigilance Commission from 
time to time. If any instance of variance between the provisions of this 
Manual and other Government Manuals comes to notice, the matter 
should be immediately referred to the Ministry of Defence for clarification.  
  
6 
In such cases, however, the on-going procurement need not be stopped 
pending resolution of the issue, if the requirement is operationally urgent 
or delay is likely to have any adverse implications. 
 
1.5.2 Validity of internal orders and instructions: Internal orders and 
instructions, including Standard Operating Procedures SOPs), issued by 
various Wings of the Ministry of Defence and the Services may be 
deemed to have been modified by the provisions of this Manual, to the 
extent the former are not in conformity with this Manual. This is necessary 
for ensuring uniformity among the purchase practices followed by various 
wings of the Ministry and the Services. The concerned Wings of the 
Ministry and Services may take necessary action to suitably modify their 
internal instructions and orders accordingly. 
 
1.5.3  Applicability of the Manual to OFB and DRDO: Purchases made by the 
Ordnance Factories are regulated by the provisions of the Material 
Management and Procurement Manual, 2005. DRDO also follows the 
procedure laid down in the Purchase Manual, 2006. Ordnance Factories 
Board and the DRDO would take immediate steps to review the said 
Manuals and make necessary amendments, if required, to ensure that the 
provisions thereof are in conformity with the provisions of this Manual.   
 
1.5.4 Applicability of instructions/orders issued in future: The provisions of 
this Manual would be subject to general or special instructions/orders/ 
amendments which the Government may issue from time. 
 
1.6 Removal of doubts and modification 
 
1.6.1 Doubts and modifications: Where any instance of variance between the 
provisions of this Manual and other Government Manuals comes to notice 
or a doubt arises as to the interpretation of any provision of this manual, 
the matter should be referred through proper channel to the designated 
officer/section in the Finance Division of the Ministry of Defence. Pending 
further instructions, JS & Additional Financial Advisor (A) will be the 
designated officer for this purpose. If required, such references would be 
placed before an empowered committee to be set up under Secretary 
(Defence Finance)/ Financial Advisor (Defence Services). The Chairman 
of the Committee may set up sub-committee(s). Suggestions for 
 improvements/ amendments, if any, may also be sent to JS & Addl FA (A).   
 1.7 Deviation from procedure  
1.7.1 Instructions to be followed: There should normally be no occasion to 
deviate from the procedure as sufficient flexibility has been built into the 
provisions of this Manual. However, if such a need arises, the matter 
should be referred through the Principal Staff Officer concerned to the JS 
& Additional Financial Advisor concerned for approval of Secretary 
  
7 
(Defence Finance)/FA (DS) and Defence Secretary. Depending on the 
merit of a case, the matter may also be submitted for approval of the 
Raksha Mantri (RM). If considered necessary, the designated officer, 
referred to in paragraph 1.6.1 may be consulted before the matter is 
submitted to the Secretary (Defence Finance)/FA (DS) to maintain 
uniformity. In any case, brief particulars of all such deviations should be 
communicated to the said officer after approval of the Secretary (Defence 
Finance/FA (DS) and Defence Secretary/RM.

CHAPTER 2 
 
PROCUREMENT – OBJECTIVE AND POLICY 
 
 2.1 Procurement 
2.1.1  Fundamental Principles of Public Buying: Every authority delegated 
with the financial powers of procuring goods in public interest shall have 
the responsibility and accountability to bring efficiency, economy, 
transparency in matters relating to public procurement and for fair and 
equitable treatment of suppliers and promotion of competition in public 
procurement. 
 
2.1.2  Procedural Propriety: The procedure to be followed in making public 
procurement must conform to the following yardsticks: 
 
a) the specifications in terms of quality, type etc., as also quantity of 
goods to be procured, should be clearly spelt out keeping in view the 
specific needs of the procuring organizations. The specifications so 
worked out should meet the basic needs of the organization without 
including superfluous and non-essential features, which may result in 
unwarranted expenditure. Care should also be taken to avoid 
purchasing quantities in excess of requirement to avoid inventory 
carrying costs; 
 
b) offers should be invited following a fair, transparent and reasonable 
procedure; 
 
c) the procuring authority should be satisfied that the selected offer 
adequately meets the requirement in all respects; 
 
d) the procuring authority should satisfy itself that the price of the selected 
offer is reasonable and  consistent with the quality required; 
 
e) at each stage of procurement the concerned procuring authority must 
place on record, in precise terms, the considerations which weighed 
with it while taking the procurement decision.  
 
2.1.3 Channels of Procurement: Procurement of stores will in general be done 
by one of the following methods: 
 
(a) Placing demands on the Director General of Ordnance 
Factories for manufacture of stores in Ordnance Factories; 
 
(b) Placing demands on: 
(i) 
Other Ministries of the Government of India. 
  
9 
(ii) 
State Governments, for supply from factories/ workshops/ 
other procurement agencies under them 
 
(c) Placing 
demands 
on 
the 
Industries/Factories/Statutory 
Corporations – whether wholly or partly financed by the State 
set-up for the manufacture of specific range of items in the 
country; 
 
(d) Placing demands on the indigenous trade either directly or 
through the Director General of Supplies and Disposals 
including Textile Commissioner, Mumbai; 
 
(e) Local Purchase in respect of items which are not supplied by 
the central procurement authority/ organizations of the             
Services  / Departments and stores emergently required; and 
 
(f) Placing demands on Defence Public Sector Undertakings and 
other Government Public Sector Undertakings for purchase / 
repair/manufacture/fabrication 
of 
items/equipment/systems/ 
aircrafts etc. to meet Defence Services  requirements.  
 
 2.2 Policy Guidelines 
2.2.1 Economy: Purchases of stores must be made in the most economical 
manner and in accordance with the definite requirements of the defence 
Services. Stores should not be purchased in small quantities. Periodical 
indents should be prepared covering the requirement for one year or 
more, except where for reasons of short life or for other recorded reasons 
it is necessary to procure lesser quantities. Care should also be taken not 
to purchase stores much in advance of actual requirements, if such 
purchase is likely to prove unprofitable to the Government, and thus 
locking up of capital in stock should be minimized. 
 
2.2.2 Scales: Where scales of consumption or limits of stores have been laid 
down by the competent authority, the officer ordering a supply should 
certify on the purchase order/demands that the prescribed scales or limits 
are not exceeded. 
 
2.2.3 Splitting: Purchase order should not be split to avoid the necessity for 
obtaining the sanction of the higher authority required with reference to the 
total amount of the orders. 
 
  
10 
 
2.2.4 Open competitive tendering: When stores are purchased from 
contractors, the system of open competitive tender should normally be the 
preferred mode, except where otherwise permissible under the rules and 
the purchase should be made from the lowest tenderer. 
 
 2.3 Decentralization and delegation of powers 
2.3.1  Decentralization: With implementation of the New Management Strategy 
(NMS) in the three Services, the Government has decentralized decision-
making process so as to enhance efficiency and expedite decision-
making. The procurement function has also been decentralized and most 
of the defence organizations undertake bulk of the central procurement 
and local purchase themselves. While DGS&D continues to conclude Rate 
Contracts for supply of general use items, service specific items are being 
procured by the procurement agencies of the Service concerned. It must 
be ensured that all procurement officers meticulously follow the laid down 
procedures. 
 
2.3.2  Delegation of Powers: With the objective of decentralizing powers to 
enable effective use of resources by the actual operators, financial powers 
have been delegated to various authorities in the defence establishments 
down to the unit commanders. These powers are to be used within the 
framework of laid down procedures, cannons of financial propriety and 
amplificatory instructions. The powers so delegated also imply 
accountability and the CFAs must ensure that financial propriety and 
probity are observed in all cases.     
 
 2.4 Types of Procurement 
2.4.1  Capital Procurement: As per Rule 90 of the General Financial Rules, 
2005, significant expenditure incurred with the object of acquiring tangible 
assets of a permanent nature (for use in the organization and not for sale 
in the ordinary course of business) or enhancing the utility of the existing 
assets, shall broadly be defined as Capital expenditure. Further, as per 
Rule 91 (a) of the General Financial Rules, 2005, Capital shall bear all 
charges for the first construction and equipment of a project as well as 
charges for intermediate maintenance of the work while not yet opened for 
service. It shall also bear charges for such further additions and 
improvements, which enhance the useful life of the asset. Capital 
procurement would, therefore, refer to procurement of all goods and 
services that fit the description of capital expenditure. The procedure for 
capital procurement is separately laid down in the Defence Procurement 
Procedure, 2008.   
 
2.4.2  Revenue Procurement: As per Rule 91 of the General Financial Rules, 
2005, revenue should bear all subsequent charges for maintenance and 
  
11 
all working expenses, including all expenditure on working and upkeep of 
the project and also on such renewals and replacements and such 
additions, improvements or extensions, etc., as under rules made by the 
Government are debitable to revenue account. The revenue procurement, 
therefore, implies procurement of items and equipments, including 
replacement equipment (functionally similar) assemblies/sub assemblies 
and components, to maintain and operate already sanctioned assets in 
the service, the necessity of which has been established and accepted by 
the Government. In the context of defence procurements, what would 
constitute revenue procurement is defined in Chapter 1 of this Manual  
 
2.4.3 Financial powers for procurement: For Revenue Procurement, 
Government has delegated financial powers under revenue heads to a 
number of authorities in each Service/Department. Procurements involving 
financial implications beyond the delegated powers of the Service HQrs 
and Heads of the ISOs are undertaken with the approval of the Ministry of 
Defence. 
 
2.4.4  Indigenous Procurement: Procurement from indigenous sources is called 
indigenous procurement. It is the policy of the Government to encourage 
indigenization, particularly in the field of defence to achieve self-reliance. 
Hence, indigenous firms should be given all support to produce and 
supply quality goods conforming to specifications. Proper loading criteria 
for all taxes, duties and other expenses involved in procurement of an item 
need to be applied to provide a level playing field to the indigenous 
manufacturers. Payments against indigenous procurement are made in 
rupee terms. 
 
2.4.5  Foreign Procurement (Import): For such defence equipments and 
assets, which are of foreign origin, items required to maintain and operate 
these equipments may also need to be procured from suppliers abroad. 
The procedure for such procurement is laid down in Chapters 9 and 10 of 
this Manual.   
  
2.4.6  Central Procurement: Central Procurement (CP) is undertaken against 
indents resulting from planned provisioning process like the Annual 
Provision Review, refit planning, obsolescence planning and planned 
routines. CP indents normally cover the entire requirement of the item for 
the duration of the provisioning period. 
 
2.4.7  Local Procurement: Local Purchase (LP) is undertaken within the LP 
powers of various authorities as per the delegated powers in the following 
circumstances: 
  
(a) To meet the short-term, ad-hoc or urgent requirements of units/ 
establishments when supplies are not available through the central 
  
12 
provisioning agency. Intimation regarding such purchases should 
immediately be sent to the central provisioning agency so that the latter 
could take the quantities procured through local purchase into account. 
  
(b) To meet the normal requirements of units/establishments for stores 
which are not within the purview of central purchase organizations. 
 
2.4.8 Procurement from Ordnance Factories and Defence Public Sector 
Undertakings: The following guidelines should be followed for 
procurement of goods/services from the Ordnance Factories and Defence 
 Public Sector Undertakings: 
(a) After acceptance of necessity, all stores falling within the product range 
of the Ordnance Factories should be procured through the Ordnance 
Factories Board (OFB) by placing indents without issuing RFPs. In the 
case of emergent purchase, items falling within OFB’s product range may 
be procured from trade following the tendering procedure but only after 
obtaining a “No Objection Certificate” from the OFB. All requests for 
obtaining No Objection Certificate should be addressed to the Secretary, 
Ordnance Factories Board, 10-A, S. K. Bose Road, Kolkata 700 001 (Fax 
 No. 033-22482927). 
(b) Goods and Services may be procured from Defence Public Sector 
Undertakings by following the tendering procedure. Any item developed/ 
manufactured by a Defence PSU specifically for the Defence Services, 
with transfer of technology or through design and development, should be 
procured from the concerned Defence PSU only. Similarly, Defence PSUs 
shall be approached for providing any service, such as repairs and 
overhauling, if facility for providing such services has been set up by a 
 Defence PSU exclusively for the Defence Services.  
(c) Cases falling under (a) & (b) above, including procurement against 
provision review for scaled items, will not be treated as STE/PAC 
 procurements.   
 
(d) For induction of new equipment or procurement of new goods and 
services on the basis of global/open/limited tendering, RFPs should also 
be issued to the OFB/concerned Defence PSUs. In such cases, tender 
fee, EMD and PBG need not be taken from the OFB/Defence PSU. 
 
2.4.9  Purchase of goods and services without quotation: Purchase of goods 
and services up to the value of Rs. 15,000/- (Rupees Fifteen Thousand) 
only on each occasion may be made without inviting quotations or bids on 
the basis of a certificate to be recorded by the Competent Financial 
 Authority in the following format. 
  
13 
"I, 
___________________, 
am 
personally 
satisfied 
that 
these 
goods/services purchased are of the requisite quality and specification 
and have been purchased from a reliable supplier/service provider at a 
reasonable price." 
 
2.4.10 Purchase of goods by Purchase Committee: Purchase of goods 
costing above Rs. 15,000/- (Rupees Fifteen Thousand) only and up to Rs. 
1,00,000/- (Rupees one lakh) only on each occasion may be made on the 
recommendations of a duly constituted Local Purchase Committee 
consisting of three members of an appropriate level as decided by the 
Competent Financial Authority. The committee will be required to survey 
the market to ascertain the reasonableness of rate, quality and 
specifications and identify the appropriate supplier. Before recommending 
placement of the purchase order, the members of the committee should 
jointly record a certificate as under: 
 
"Certified that we, _____________________, members of the local 
purchase committee are jointly and individually satisfied that the 
goods/services recommended for purchase are of the requisite 
specification and quality, priced at the prevailing market rate and the 
supplier recommended is reliable and competent to supply the goods in 
question." 
 
2.4.11 Obtaining of Quotations by the Local Purchase Committee: The 
Competent Financial Authority may direct the local purchase committee 
responsible for carrying out the market survey to obtain quotations as a 
part of the market survey.  Where no such direction has been given, it 
would be up to the purchase committee to decide whether or not to obtain 
quotations as a part of documentation of market survey. In either case, 
however, details of the market survey (suppliers contacted and the rates 
quoted by them) would be recorded by the local purchase committee. 
  
2.4.12 Purchase of goods directly under Rate Contract: Goods for which 
Director General of Supply & Disposal (DGS&D) has rate contracts can be 
procured directly from the suppliers. While resorting to such procurement 
it should be ensured that the prices to be paid for the goods do not exceed 
those stipulated in the rate contract and the other salient terms and 
conditions of the purchase are in line with those specified in the rate 
contract. The Purchaser should also make its own arrangement for 
inspection and testing of such goods, where required. In the case of 
drugs, consumables, FOL, hygiene chemicals, etc. the inspection may be 
done by DGQA/NABL but any costs incurred thereon should be borne by 
the Suppliers. Payment in such cases would be made by the concerned 
Principal Controllers/Controllers of Defence Accounts, their subordinate 
offices or other paying authorities as per the existing arrangement. 
Wherever Senior Accounts Officers/Imprest Holders are authorized, 
  
14 
payment may be made by them. The format for placing Supply Order on 
Rate contracts is given at Appendix F. 
 
2.4.13 Non-application of the provisions of this Manual: Provisions of this 
Manual will not be applicable in the case of procurements made under 
delegated financial powers of certain specified authorities in the Defence 
Services which are exercisable by them without IFA’s concurrence during 
period preparatory to war, hostilities, special operations, natural calamities 
and disasters. Provisions of this paragraph should be invoked only as and 
when the aforesaid eventualities are notified by the Government. Separate 
orders laying down the fast track procedure to be followed uniformly by the 
three Services would be laid down by the Ministry of Defence.   
 
2.4.14 Cash and Carry Procurement: Cash and carry purchase is a type of LP 
(local purchase) resorted to in case of extreme urgency or when the 
supplier is not willing to supply the required item on credit. Cash and carry 
powers are very limited as such procurement is made only in exceptional 
cases when cash payment is made from the imprest of the unit and the 
same is claimed from the paying authority who reimburses the amount 
 after due audit of the transaction.     
 2.5 Product  Reservation, Purchase/Price Preference and other facilities 
2.5.1  Product Reservation for Khadi Village Industries Commission (KVIC), 
etc.: The Government of India, through administrative instructions, has 
reserved all items of handspun and hand woven textiles (khadi goods) for 
exclusive purchase from Khadi Village Industries Commission (KVIC). It 
has also reserved all items of handloom textiles required by Central 
Government departments for exclusive purchase from KVIC and/or the 
notified handloom units of ACASH (Association of Corporations and Apex 
Societies of Handlooms). Purchases of such reserved goods and items 
would be made from these units. Form DPM-4 gives the details of such 
items. 
 
2.5.2   Product Reservation and other facilities for Micro, Small and Medium 
Enterprises (MSMEs): The Government of India has also reserved some 
items for purchase from registered Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises 
(MSMEs). A list of 358 such items is given in Form DPM-1. Under the

Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) and their subsidiaries: The policy 
of the Government of India to grant purchase preference exclusively to 
Pharma CPSEs and their subsidiaries, as laid down in Ministry of 
Chemicals and Fertilizers, Department of Chemicals and Fertilizers Office 
memorandum No. 50013/1/2006-SO(Pl-IV) dated 7th August 2006, would 
be followed while purchasing medical stores. A copy of the said office 
Memorandum is at Form DPM-2.     
 
2.5.4  Local Purchase of Stationery and other articles from Kendriya 
Bhandar, NCCF, etc.: Keeping in view the avowed objectives of the co-
operative movement to ensure supply of goods and services to the 
consumers at the most economical and competitive prices and taking note 
of the changed concepts of marketing, the Government of India vide  
DoP&T (Welfare Section) OM No. 14/12/94-Welfare (Vol II) dated 5th July 
2007 (given in Form DPM-3)  has decided to adopt the following 
dispensation in respect of all Central Government Departments, their 
attached and subordinate offices and other organizations financed and/or 
controlled by them in making local purchases of stationery and other items 
from Kendriya Bhandar/National Consumer Cooperatives Federation:    
 
(a) 
As per paragraph 2.4.9 of this Chapter, purchase of goods up to 
Rs.15,000 is permissible without inviting quotations or bids.  Further, as 
per paragraph 2.4.10 of this Chapter, a Local Purchase Committee 
constituted by the CFA can make purchase of goods up to Rs.1 lakh on 
the basis of a market survey to ascertain the reasonableness of rate, 
quality, etc. and submission of a certificate to that effect.  In partial 
modification of these provisions, it would be permissible to make 
purchase, at the discretion of the CFA, of all items required for office 
consumption up to Rs.1 lakh on each occasion directly from Kendriya 
Bhandar/NCCF without calling for quotations. The responsibility for 
ensuring the reasonableness of rates, quality specifications etc. will be 
equally that of the Purchasing Ministry/Department and KB/NCCF. 
Further, the reasonableness of rates, quality, specifications, etc. should be 
certified by the Local Purchase Committee as envisaged in paragraph 
2.4.10 above.  It is to be ensured that supply orders are not split under any 
circumstances with the objective of circumventing the limit of Rs.1 Lakh.  
 
(b) 
For procurement of all items of office consumption beyond                   
Rs.1 lakh up to Rs 25 lakh, where limited tenders are to be invited as per 
the provisions of this Manual, KB and NCCF among others should also be 
  
16 
invited to participate in such limited tenders, in case these cooperatives 
are functioning at the station.  Other things being equal, Purchase 
Preference will be granted to KB/NCCF, if the price quoted by the 
cooperatives is within 10% of the L1 price and if these cooperatives are 
willing to match the L1 price.  No price preference over and above the L1 
price shall be given to these cooperatives.  However, KB/NCCF will be 
exempted from furnishing bid security (Earnest Money Deposit).  
 
(c) 
Supply orders up to Rs. 25 lakh, in respect of office equipments 
covered under the DGS&D rate contract may also be procured from KB 
and NCCF provided KB/NCCF offer the items at DGS&D rate contracted 
prices as also fulfill all the contractual obligations which the 
manufacturers/suppliers of such products are required to meet under the 
DGS&D rate contract.  The Purchaser will have to make his own 
arrangements for inspection and testing of such goods, where required.  
 
(d) 
The above dispensation shall be applicable only up to 31.3.2010. 
 
(e) 
Other Multi-State Co-operative Societies registered prior to the 
issue of DoP&T (Welfare Section) OM No. 14/12/94-Welfare (Vol II) dated 
5th July 2007 in which the majority of the shares are held by the Central 
Government, are also permitted to avail of the facility of Purchase 
Preference in respect of limited tender enquiries up to Rs. 25 lakh. 
 
2.5.5  Purchase Preference: Purchase preference policy for Central Public 
Sector Enterprises has been terminated with effect from 31.03.2008 vide 
DPE OM No. DPE/13(15)/2007-Fin dated 21st November 2007 (not 
reproduced in this Manual). However, this termination does not apply to 
the purchase preference allowed for sector specific CPSEs for which the 
purchase preference policy is laid down by the Ministries concerned, as in 
the case of pharma products, as per paragraph 2.5.3 above.  
 
 2.6 Time limit and accountability 
2.6.1  Time Limit for Procurement & Accountability:  The effect of delay in 
processing and clearance of various procurement activities needs no 
emphasis. The decentralization of decision-making mechanism and 
delegation of financial powers are aimed at facilitating faster decision 
making and obtaining the best value for money.  However, delegation of 
powers also implies ‘authority with accountability’.  Every individual in the 
chain of the procurement process is accountable for taking action in a 
specified time period so that the requirements of the Defence 
Departments are met on time. A flow chart showing major activities and 
time frame prescribed is placed at Appendix ‘A’.

CHAPTER 3 
 
SOURCING AND QUALITY 
 
 3.1 General 
3.1.1 Identification of suitable suppliers: Proper source knowledge and 
identification of suitable suppliers capable of meeting the product quality 
required by the defence departments, particularly by the Defence 
Services, are vital functions for ensuring procurement of quality goods.  
Providing equal opportunity and ensuring fair play are also important 
requirements in any procurement process so as to achieve transparency. 
Hence, the selection and registration of firms, their performance appraisal 
and classification must be clearly spelt out and properly disseminated. 
 
 3.2 Registration of Firms 
3.2.1 Registration by the Central Procurement Agencies: The detailed 
procedure for registration of firms is given in Joint Services Guide on 
Assessment and registration of Suppliers for Defence (JSG: 015: 03:2007) 
published by the Directorate of Standardization, Department of Defence 
Production, Ministry of Defence. JSG is an enabling document which 
serves as a guide for procurement agencies to formulate guidelines for 
registration of vendors. The publication is available on DGQA website 
www.dgqadefence.gov.in. It can also be obtained on payment from the 
Director, Directorate of Standardization, Ministry of Defence, New Delhi 
110 011. 
 
3.2.2  Registration by Agencies at the Command and Other Levels: Apart 
from the central procurement agencies at the Services Headquarters, 
firms should also be registered by the Command Headquarters, Depots, 
Workshops and Naval Dockyards, etc., as per the instructions contained in 
this Chapter.  
 
3.2.3  Registration at the Unit Level: It would not be necessary to register the 
firms at the unit level for the purpose of carrying out local purchase. 
However, the reputation, capacity and credibility must be ascertained 
before obtaining quotations from or placing supply orders on a particular 
firm. 
 
3.2.4  Scrutiny of the Credentials of the Firms: It is essential that the 
credentials of the firms applying for registration, including their financial 
status, the manufacturing and quality control facilities, the business ethics 
and their market standing are thoroughly scrutinized before registering 
them as an approved source of supply. 
 
  
  
18 
3.2.5  Inter-Services and Inter-Departmental Acceptability of Registration: A 
firm registered with any department of the Ministry of Defence, the 
Services or OFB or the Inter-services organizations, may be considered 
as a registered firm for procurement by other departments of the ministry 
or the other services, for the same range of products/goods/services for 
which the firm is registered with any of the aforesaid organizations.   
 
3.2.6  Registration of Suppliers and Service Providers: The Joint Services 
Guide on Assessment and registration of Suppliers for Defence (JSG: 
015: 03:2007) is applicable mainly to registration of manufacturing firms as 
suppliers. The guidelines and procedures laid down therein may, however, 
also be applied, mutatis mutandis, by the Registering Agencies to other 
suppliers and service providers till such time as a separate procedure is 
laid down by DGQA.  
 
 3.3 Assessment of Performance of the Registered Firms   
3.3.1  Criteria for Assessment of Performance: Performance of the registered 
firms must be reviewed by the procurement agencies periodically and 
reported to the Registering Agency. While the detailed guidelines in this 
regard are contained in DGQA Publication JSG:015:03 – 2007, the 
general criteria for assessing the performance of the registered firms are 
 as follows: 
(a) 
Quality: Quality has to be assessed from the inspector’s report as 
 well as the feedback from the actual users. 
(b) 
Delivery: Delivery compliance has to be assessed from the delivery 
data against purchase orders placed on the firm. The purchaser could 
generate the data from the computer records to determine the percentage 
of orders in which delivery was completed within the original delivery date 
 as per the contract/supply order.   
(c) 
Price: Price competitiveness of a firm has to be assessed against 
its ability to secure orders on competitive basis.  Orders secured as 
percentage of quotes should indicate the price competitiveness of the 
 supplier. This data can be generated from the computer records.  
(d) 
Response: The response analysis of the firms could  be carried out 
in terms of number of quotes submitted against the number of RFPs sent 
to them. Computer generated data for quotes received as a percentage of 
 RFPs sent could be one of the valid criteria for response analysis. 
(e) 
Product Support: Product support record of a firm may be 
determined on the basis of response to enquiries for spare parts and 
maintenance services for the equipment originally supplied by that firm.  
 
  
19 
3.3.2  Assessment of Technical and Financial Capabilities: The technical and 
financial capabilities of the firms, including their past performance, must 
be carefully evaluated and verified by a Board of Officers constituted by 
AHSP/Registering 
Agencies 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
considering 
registration/renewal of registration. The Registering Agency may also co-
opt a representative of the User. IFA may be associated with assessment 
of the financial capabilities of the firm, if considered necessary by the 
CFA. 
The 
format 
for 
preparing 
Verification 
Report 
of 
Vendor 
capacity/capability has been given in Form DPM-5. 
 
 3.4 Removal from the List of the Approved Firms 
3.4.1  Removal from the List: Whenever a firm is found lacking in performance 
in terms of response, delivery compliance, capacity, quality standards, 
ethics or any other valid reason, the firm may be removed from the list by 
the registering authority after giving notice of proposed removal to the firm.  
Besides, there may be registered firms which may have ceased to exist or 
may have been acquired by or merged with another firm, may have 
switched over to other sectors of business operation or indulged in 
unethical business practices and influence peddling. Such firms should be 
removed from the list of approved vendors after giving them notice of the 
proposed removal. 
 
3.4.2  Effect of Removal from the List: Whenever a firm is removed from the 
list of approved vendors, its registration stands cancelled. Such removal 
must be communicated to all other registering and procuring agencies so 
that no further business relations are maintained with such firms.   
 
 
 3.5 Ban on dealings with a firm 
3.5.1  Ban on dealings: When the misconduct of a firm or its continued poor 
performance justifies imposition of ban on business relations with the firm, 
this action should be taken by the appropriate authority after due 
consideration of all factors and circumstances of the case and after giving 
 due notice.   
 3.6 Specification 
3.6.1  Specifications: Items bought by the defence department, particularly the 
defence services, must be manufactured as per or conforming to the 
specifications. The specifications are the detailed qualitative requirements 
of the item being procured and should indicate the material composition, 
physical, dimensional and performance parameters, tolerances, if any, 
manufacturing process where applicable, test schedule, preservation and 
packing etc. AHSP/ Specification promulgating authority should forward 
copies of specification/amendments to all the concerned procurement 
  
20 
agencies periodically. Various types of specifications relevant to the 
 defence items are as follows: 
(a) 
PAC Specifications: These are available only with the proprietary 
firms and are protected by the intellectual property right. Hence, PAC 
specifications are normally not available with the purchaser and firm’s 
certificate of quality is accepted. However, essential characteristics 
required for inspection should be available with the procuring and 
inspecting agencies. 
 
(b) 
Branded Product:  The specification for branded commercial 
product is not available with the purchaser or the inspecting agency and 
 these are to be accepted on the firm’s guarantee. 
(c) 
Industrial 
Specification: 
There 
are 
standard 
industrial 
specifications like the IS, BS, DIN and GOST available for sale in the 
market. In the case of medical stores standard specifications are issued 
by WHO, FDA, CE etc. Every procuring and inspecting agency should 
acquire such specifications for reference to ensure quality standards of the 
 product being procured. 
(d) 
Defence Specifications: There are defence specifications for 
specialist items for use by the defence departments, particularly the 
Defence Services. These are Joint Services Specification, Milspecs, etc. 
Copies of such specifications should be available with the procuring 
 agency, authority and the AHSP. 
(e) 
Indigenized Item:. The manufacturing agency, QA agency, DRDO 
and Service Headquarters, involved in the indigenization efforts often 
successfully indigenize some items as import substitute. In such cases, 
the specification including the drawing and other details are formulated by 
these agencies in consultation with the manufacturing firms/QA 
agency/Design agency/Service HQrs, as the case may be, to guide future 
production. Such specifications should be available with the purchase 
agency as well as the inspecting authority so as to ensure conformity with 
 the required quality standards of the items being supplied. 
(f) 
Ad-hoc Specifications: There are items for which neither industrial 
nor defence specifications are available. In such cases, the indentor must 
indicate the general parameters, normally the dimensional and 
performance parameters to enable procurement and inspection. Such ad-
hoc specifications must be broad enough to permit wider participation by 
the suppliers and should not be restrictive so that adequate competition is 
 not obviated. 
(g) 
As per Sample:  There are occasions when items, normally PAC 
products, cannot be procured from the original manufacturer and have to 
  
21 
be procured from another manufacturer as per sample in the absence of 
detailed specifications or drawing. For such items the supplier prepares 
detailed specification as well as the drawing. The purchaser and the 
inspecting authority should acquire such specifications and drawings and 
 retain with them to guide future production and inspection. 
(h) 
Common Use Items: There are a large number of items in use by 
the defence departments and defence services, which are common-use 
items, freely available in the open market. As in the case of ad-hoc 
specifications, specifications of common use items should also be broad 
enough to permit wider participation by the suppliers and should not be 
restrictive so that it does not pre-empt adequate competition. 
 
 3.7 Inspection Note 
3.7.1  Waiver of inspection note: There would be no requirement of Inspection 
Note in respect of items procured against specifications mentioned at 
3.6.1 (f), (g) & (h) above or for items available commercially off-the-shelf 
(COTS) or in respect of items for which testing facilities do not exist with 
AHSP/DGQA. Such items may be accepted based on self-certification by 
the firm and inspection by a Board of Officers at the user’s end. Relevant 
certificate from the firm should be enclosed with the bill by the 
procurement agency.

CHAPTER 4 
TENDERING 
 
 4.1 Types of Tendering 
4.1.1  Procurement of goods by obtaining bids: Except for cases covered by 
paragraphs 2.4.9 (purchase of goods without obtaining quotations), 2.4.10 
(purchase of goods through Purchase Committee) and 2.4.12 (purchase 
of goods against Rate Contracts) of Chapter 2 of this Manual, goods 
should be procured by adopting one of the following standard methods of 
obtaining bids: 
 
(a) Advertised Tender Enquiry (also known as Open Tender Enquiry);  
(b) Limited tender Enquiry; and 
(c) Single Tender Enquiry. 
 
4.1.2 Procurement of Services: The above mentioned methods will also be 
applicable for procurement of services, subject to other instructions 
contained in this Manual being followed. 
 
 
 4.2 Advertised Tender Enquiry/Open Tender Enquiry (ATE/OTE) 
4.2.1  Advertised/Open Tender Enquiry: The Open Tendering system should 
be the preferred mode for procurement of common use items of generic or 
commercial specifications which are readily available off-the-shelf in the 
market from a wide range of sources/vendors. It must be adopted in all 
such cases in which the estimated value of the tender is more than Rs 
twenty five lakhs, subject to the exceptions as provided for in this Chapter. 
 
4.2.2  Global Tender Enquiry: Where it is felt that the goods/services of the 
required quality, specifications, etc., may not be available in the country 
and it is necessary to also look for suitable competitive offers from abroad, 
copies of the tender enquiry may be sent to the Indian embassies abroad 
as well as the foreign embassies in India. The selection of embassies 
would depend on the possibility of availability of the required 
goods/services in such countries. The tender enquiries may also be sent 
through the Defence Attachés wherever they are posted in the Embassies 
and High Commissions. 
 
4.2.3  Publicity: Open tender system involves wide publicity through advertising 
media (Press, Trade, Journals etc).  Open tender notifications should be 
sent to the Director General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics, 
  
23 
Kolkata for publication in the Indian Trade Journal (ITJ) and to the DAVP, 
New Delhi for publication at least in one leading daily, which has a wide 
circulation. Such notifications should also be published in the bulletin, if 
any, of the Service/Department concerned.   
 
4.2.4  Preparation of the Notice Inviting Tender: The Notice Inviting Tender 
(NIT), to be published in the journals/newspapers in the case of 
Advertised/Open Tender Enquiry, should be carefully drafted. It should 
contain salient features of the requirement in brief to give a clear idea to 
the prospective tenderers about the requirements. Superfluous or 
irrelevant details should not be incorporated in the tender notice, as it will 
needlessly increase the cost of advertisement. The tender notice should 
normally contain the following information:  
 
(a) Description and specification of the goods and quantity 
(b) Period and terms of delivery 
(c) Cost of the tender/bidding document 
(d) Place(s) and timing of sale of tender documents 
(e) Address of the website from where the tender document could be 
downloaded 
 
(f) Place and deadline for receipt of tenders 
(g) Place, time and date for opening of tenders 
(h) Amount and form of Bid security/Earnest Money Deposit 
(i) Any other important information 
 
4.2.5  Publicity through the website:  All OTE notifications in respect of non-
lethal/security and non-sensitive items should invariably be posted on the 
website of the Ministry of Defence, as also on the websites of the Service 
HQ/Department concerned, wherever such websites already exist. A link 
may also be provided to the NIC website. The website address should 
also be given in the notifications advertised through the ITJ and the 
newspapers. 
 
4.2.6  Direct dispatch of tender documents: In case of OTE, Notice Inviting 
Tenders (NIT) and/or tender forms may also be sent to all suppliers 
registered for the particular range of items.   
 
4.2.7 Tender documents on the website: The complete tender document 
should be posted on the website and the prospective bidders should be 
permitted to make use of the documents downloaded from the website. If 
such a downloaded document is priced, there should be clear instructions 
  
24 
for the bidder to pay the amount by demand draft, etc., along with the bid. 
Such documents must be secured to avoid possibility of modification and 
 restriction of access to bidders. 
4.2.8  Time to be given for submission of bids:  Ordinarily the minimum time 
to be allowed for submission of bids should be three weeks from the date 
of publication of the tender notice or availability of the bidding document 
for sale, whichever is later. Reduced time frame for submission of bids 
may be adopted in the case of emergent local purchase of supplies, 
provisions and medicines by use of FAX, e-tendering etc. as permissible.  
 
4.2.9 Unregistered firms claiming compliance: In OTE cases, where an 
unregistered firm claiming compliance of technical specifications meets 
the laid down technical parameters detailed in the RFP, before opening 
the commercial bid of such firm, assessment of capability of the firm by 
procuring/registering agency would be mandatory. This capability 
verification will, however, not amount to automatic registration of the firm 
by the Registering Authority. However, in the case of specialized and 
critical medical equipment/stores, where DGQA and DGS&D are presently 
not registering the firms on the grounds that SPQR are not formulated by 
them but by the users, manufacturers of national repute or their authorized 
agents may be considered, based on financial status and market 
reputation/past performance of the firm, as at present. 
 
 4.3 Limited Tender Enquiry (LTE) 
4.3.1  Limited Tender Enquiry: This method may be adopted when estimated 
value of the goods to be procured is up to Rupees Twenty-five lakhs. 
Normally, the number of supplier firms in Limited Tender Enquiry should 
be more than three. However, Limited Tender Enquiry may be resorted to 
also when there are only two or three known sources of supply. 
 
4.3.2  Limited Tender Enquiry in Special Circumstances: Purchase through 
Limited Tender Enquiry may be adopted even where the estimated value 
of the procurement is more than Rupees twenty five lakhs, in the following 
circumstances, subject to approval by the CFA and in consultation with the 
IFA, where required as per delegation of financial powers: 
 
(a) The Indenter certifies that the demand is urgent and any additional 
expenditure involved by not procuring through advertised tender enquiry is 
justified in view of urgency. The nature of the urgency and reasons why 
the procurement could not be anticipated should also be placed on record. 
 
b) There are sufficient reasons, to be recorded in writing by the competent 
authority, indicating that it will not be in public interest to procure the 
goods through advertised tender enquiry. 
 
  
25 
(c) The sources of supply are definitely known and possibility of fresh 
source(s) beyond those being tapped is remote. 
 
(d)The nature of item to be procured is such that pre-verification of the 
competence of the firms and their registration is essential.   
 
4.3.3  Publicity and dispatch of tender documents: Copies of the bidding 
document should be sent directly by speed post/registered post/ courier/e-
mail/fax to firms which are borne on the list of registered suppliers for the 
goods in question. Copies of the bidding documents should also be sent 
by registered post to the firms to whom these are initially sent by fax/e-
mail. Web based publicity should be given for Limited Tender Enquiry also 
and efforts should be made to identify a higher number of approved 
suppliers to obtain more responsive bids on competitive basis. 
 
4.3.4  Time to be given for submission of bids:  Sufficient time, normally 
ranging from one to three weeks, should be allowed for submission of bids 
in Limited tender Enquiries.  For perishable goods or consumables a 
reduced time frame may be followed.  
 
4.3.5  Unregistered firms claiming compliance: Though normally no such 
occasion should arise in the case of LTE, some unregistered firms may 
nevertheless submit unsolicited bids. In such cases action may be taken 
as follows: 
 
(a) If it is a two-bid tender, the technical bid of the firm may be opened and 
evaluated, where procurement does not involve any trials. If the firm is 
found to be technically compliant, further action may be taken as per 
provisions of paragraph 4.2.9 of this Manual, provided it does not entail 
any delay in procurement, defeating the very purpose of procurement. 
 
(b) If the firm is not found to be technically compliant, further cognizance 
of the tender need not be taken and the firm advised accordingly, with 
the advice to apply separately for registration. 
 
(c) In a single bid tender, the tender may be considered if it does not 
involve any trials or does not result in delay in procurement.   
 
 4.4 Single Tender Enquiry (STE) 
4.4.1  Single Tender Enquiry (STE): Procurement from a single source may be 
resorted to with the prior approval of the CFA and in consultation with the 
IFA, where required as per delegation of financial powers for reasons to 
be recorded in writing in the following circumstances, after determining 
 reasonableness of the rates: 
  
26 
(a) In a case of emergency/urgency, the required goods are necessarily to 
be purchased from a particular source.  
 
(b) On account of any other operational or technical requirement, which 
should, however, be clearly recorded. 
 
4.4.2 Reasons for recommending procurement on STE: Wherever   
applicable, the Indentor should communicate to the Procuring Agency the 
reasons for recommending STE. 
 
4.4.3 STE to be sent only to OEMs and registered firms: STE should 
generally be sent to the OEM or to a registered firm. 
 
 4.5 Procurement on the basis of the Proprietary Article Certificate (PAC)  
4.5.1 PAC Tendering: Certain items, particularly equipments, are the propriety 
product of a manufacturing firm. Such items are only available with that 
firm or their dealers, stockists or distributors as the detailed specifications 
are not available for others to manufacture the item.  Situations may also 
arise when, for standardization of machinery or ensuring compatibility of 
spare parts with the existing sets of equipment, as per the advice of the 
competent technical expert, goods and services have to be obtained from 
a particular source. In such situations, a Propriety Article Certificate (PAC) 
may be issued to the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and items 
procured on PAC basis from that particular firm or its authorized dealers, 
stockists or distributors. While PAC is issued only in respect of the 
concerned OEM, the item may be bought from any dealer, stockist or 
distributor specified in that particular PAC on the basis of the information 
provided by the OEM, provided the purchase is accompanied by a proper 
manufacturer certification. PAC once issued will be valid for two years 
from the date of issue unless cancelled earlier by the CFA. 
 
4.5.2  Repairs/servicing on the basis of PAC: The provisions of paragraph 
4.5.1 would also apply to repairs and servicing of equipment through the 
sole dealer/servicing agency, authorized by the OEM, if the main 
 equipment was purchased on the basis of PAC. 
4.5.3  Caution to be exercised while granting PAC: PAC bestows monopoly 
and obviates competition. Hence, PAC status must be granted after 
careful consideration of all factors like fitness, availability, standardization 
and value for money. Many OEMs do not manufacture assemblies, sub-
assemblies and components but outsource these items. Hence, such 
items may be available at cheaper prices with the actual manufacturers. 
The procurement officers must, therefore, keep abreast of the proper 
source knowledge and procure items from the right source to protect the 
interest of the State. However, the spares have to be sourced from OEM 
  
27 
or OEM approved/recommended manufacturers only in order to make the 
OEM responsible for the malfunctioning of the main equipment in which 
the spares have been fitted.   
 
4.5.4    The PAC Certificate should be as per the following format. 
Proprietary Article Certificate 
(Description of Goods/services):  _________________________ 
 
It is certified that: 
(i)

authority,  vide………………………. 
 
(Signature with date and designation of 
the Officer signing the PAC) 
  
 
 
 4.6 Single and Two Bid Systems 
4.6.1 Single Bid system: For stores available commercially off-the-shelf 
(COTS) and LP items, where qualitative requirements and technical 
specifications are clear, single commercial bid system may be followed. 
This system may also be followed for other procurements of non-complex 
nature. No sample should be called for in single bid system at the RFP 
stage. 
 
  
28 
4.6.2  Two bid system: For purchasing high value plant, machinery, equipment, 
IT and communication systems and for turnkey projects, etc., which are of 
a complex and technical nature or for procurement of items which have 
indeterminable parameters, such as shade, tone, make-up, feel, finish and 
workmanship, etc., bids should normally be obtained in two parts as 
follows: 
 
(a) Technical bid consisting of all technical details along with commercial 
terms and conditions; and 
 
(b) Financial bid indicating item-wise price for the items mentioned in the 
technical bid and all other commercial terms and conditions. 
 
4.6.3  Description of the user requirement: The RFP should lay down user 
requirements in a comprehensive, structured and concrete manner and 
should be broad based. The user requirements should be expressed in 
terms of functional characteristics. Its formulation must not prejudice the 
technical choices by being narrow and tailor-made. Specific Quality 
Assurance requirements, if any, should be included in the RFP. 
 
4.6.4  Manner of submission of bids in two bid system: The technical bid 
and the financial bid should be sealed by the bidder in separate covers 
duly superscribed and both these sealed covers are to be put in a bigger 
cover which should also be sealed and duly superscribed. The technical 
bids are to be opened and evaluated in the first instance. At the second 
stage, financial bids of only the technically acceptable offers should be 
 opened for further evaluation and ranking before awarding the contract.  
4.6.5 Performance parameters: The performance parameters should be 
verifiable and provide for the minimum essential military requirements. 
Fulfillment of essential parameters mentioned in the RFP would be the 
basis for further consideration by TEC (Technical Evaluation Committee). 
 
 4.7 Cost of Tender and Bid Security/Earnest Money Deposit 
 
 
4.7.1   The cost of the Tender document: Tender sets in respect of Advertised 
(Open) Tender Enquiry will be sold on payment of the prescribed price 
given below. 
 
 
Estimated value of the Tender                Price of the Tender set (Rs) 
1 Upto Rs 50 lakhs 
100
2 More than Rs 50 lakhs but upto Rs 1 
crore 
250
3 More than Rs 1 crore but upto Rs 5 
crores 
500
4 More than Rs 5 crores 
1,000
  
29 
Note: Cost of drawings and specifications will be extra. This may be 
decided in consultation with integrated finance at the time of issuing the 
RFP. 
 
4.7.2  Bid security: To safeguard against a bidder’s withdrawing or altering his 
bid during the bid validity period in the case of advertised or limited tender 
enquiry, Bid Security (also known as Earnest Money Deposit) is to be 
obtained from the bidders. The bidders should be asked to furnish the bid 
security along with their bids. 
 
4.7.3  Amount of Bid Security:  Amount of bid security should ordinarily range 
between two percent to five percent of the estimated value of the goods to 
be procured. The exact amount of bid security should be determined 
judiciously while processing the proposal for CFA’s approval and indicated 
 in the RFP.   
4.7.4  Form of Bid Security: The bid security may be accepted in the form of 
Account Payee Demand Draft, Fixed Deposit Receipt, Banker's Cheque or 
Bank Guarantee from any of the public sector banks or a private sector 
bank authorized to conduct government business, as per Form DPM-13, 
safeguarding the purchaser's interest in all respects.  
 
4.7.5  Validity of the Bid Security: The bid security is normally to remain valid 
for a period of forty-five days beyond the final bid validity period. 
 
4.7.6  Refund of Bid Security of Bidders: Bid securities of the unsuccessful 
bidders should be returned to them at the earliest after expiry of the final 
bid validity and latest on or before the 30th day after the award of the 
contract. The Bid Security of the successful bidders should be returned, 
without any interest whatsoever, after the receipt of Performance Security 
from them as called for in the contract.   
 
4.7.7 Exemption from Submission of Bid Security: Bid security is not 
required to be obtained from those firms who are registered with the 
Central Purchase Organization (e.g. DGS&D), National Small Industries 
Corporation (NSIC) or concerned Departments or Ministries of the 
Government of India. Bid security need not be asked for if the value of the 
tender is Rs two lakh or less.  
 
4.7.8  Forfeiture of the Bid Security: The bid security/earnest money will be 
liable to be forfeited if the bidder withdraws or amends, impairs or 
derogates from the tender in any respect within the validity period of his 
tender. No separate order is required for forfeiture of Bid Security which 
follows on default and should be credited at once to the Government 
Account.  
 
  
30 
4.8 Tendering Process 
4.8.1 Expression of Interest: In those cases where specifications of the 
desired goods or services are not clear or the sources are not known and 
it is considered desirable to resort to pre-qualification of suppliers, a notice 
calling for expression of interest/information may be issued and pre-bid 
conference may be held with the firms which fulfill the criteria prescribed in 
the notice to firm up the Qualitative Requirements (QRs)/specifications 
before issuing the Request for Proposal. 
 
4.8.2  Preparation of the Request for Proposal/Tender Enquiry: The Request 
for Proposal (RFP), also called Tender Enquiry (TE), is the most important 
document in the procurement process. The RFP should be prepared with 
due care and with complete details of the items or services required, terms 
and conditions including payment terms, and clear instructions to the 
bidders. The RFP should contain full and clear specifications, scope of 
requirement and the evaluation criteria, both for technical bids and 
commercial bids. RFP should be vetted by integrated finance in those 
cases where financial powers are to be exercised with their concurrence. 
The provisions of paragraph 4.6.3 of this Manual should be kept in mind 
while specifying the user requirements. 
 
4.8.3  Reference to Brand Names in the RFP:  Standards and specification, 
quoted in bidding documents in generic terms shall promote the broadest 
possible competition while assuring the critical performance or fulfillment 
of other requirements for the goods. Reference to the brand names, 
catalogue numbers, etc. in the RFP should be avoided.  
 
4.8.4 Format of RFP: The suggested format for the RFP for indigenous 
procurement of goods and services as defined in Chapter 1 of this Manual 
is given at Appendix ‘C’. The specimen format is based on various 
instructions contained in this Manual and, therefore, it should generally not 
be changed, except for minor changes relating to the text to suit the 
requirement of a specific proposal or deletion of clauses that may not be 
applicable in a particular case. It must be borne in mind that no clause 
should be incorporated in the contract/supply order if it was not mentioned 
in the RFP as inclusion of clauses in the contract which did not figure in 
the RFP would amount to unfair denial of opportunity to other suppliers.   
 
 4.9 Receipt of tenders 
4.9.1  Tender Box: In order to ensure that the bids are received by the 
purchaser in time, a tender box is to be placed in an easily accessible but 
secured place, duly locked and sealed, clearly indicating the name of the 
department. The words “Tender Box” should be written on the box in bold 
font.   
 
  
31 
4.9.2  Delivery of Bids by Hand: In cases where the tenders are required to be 
submitted by hand, it may be ensured that the names and designation of 
at least two officers are mentioned in the bid documents. The information 
about these officers should also be displayed at the entrance reception of 
the premises where tenders are to be deposited so as to ensure 
convenient approach for the bidders.   
 
 
       
 4.10 Amendment to the RFP and Extension of Tender Opening Date 
4.10.1 Amendment to the RFP: Sometimes situations may arise necessitating 
modification of the tender documents already issued (in Limited Tender 
Enquiry cases) or already put on sale (in Advertised/Open Tender Enquiry 
cases) due to change in the required quantity or specifications. In some 
cases, after receiving the documents, a tenderer may point out some 
genuine mistakes necessitating amendment in the tender documents. In 
such situations, it may become necessary to amend/modify the tender 
documents suitably prior to the date of submission of bids. Copies of such 
amendment/ modification should be simultaneously sent to all the selected 
suppliers by registered/speed post/ courier/e-mail in case of Limited 
Tender Enquiry. In case of Advertised/Open Tender Enquiry, copies of 
such amendments/ modifications should be dispatched simultaneously 
free of cost by registered/speed post/courier/e-mail to all the parties who 
may have already purchased the tender documents and copies of such 
amendments are also required to be prominently attached to the unsold 
tender documents (which are available for sale), including the tender 
documents put on the website. 
 
When the amendment/modification changes the requirement significantly 
and/or when there is not much time left for the tenderers to respond to 
such amendments, and prepare revised tender, the time and date of 
submission of tenders are also to be extended suitably, along with suitable 
changes in the corresponding time-frames for receipt of tender, tender 
validity period etc and validity period of the corresponding EMD/Bid 
security. Depending on the situation, such an amendment may also need 
fresh publication adopting the same procedure as for publication of the 
original tender enquiry. 
 
4.10.2 Extension of Tender Opening Date:  Even in those cases where 
extension of tender opening date does not become necessary because of 
the amendment to the RFP, the Competent Financial Authority, with the 
concurrence of integrated finance, where required as per delegation of 
financial powders, may extend the date of opening of the tender as 
specified in the RFP but such extension should not exceed the total 
delivery period envisaged in the RFP. Any further extension would require 
approval of the next higher CFA. Such extensions and amendments 
should be published in the same journals/newspapers in which the original 
  
32 
RFP was published and must be given publicity through the website if the 
original RFP was hosted on the website. 
 
4.10.3 Extension of Tender Opening Date After Due Date of Opening: In 
exceptional circumstances, date of opening of the tender may be 
extended within a reasonable period after the due date of the opening of 
tenders for reasons to be recorded in writing, with the approval of the 
higher CFA and in consultation with the IFA, where financial powers are to 
be exercised with the concurrence of integrated finance. 
 
 4.11 Tender Opening 
4.11.1 Opening of Tenders Under Single Bid System:  The following 
 procedure should be followed for opening of tenders: 
(a) All the tenders received on time should be opened in the presence of 
authorized representatives of the tenderers at the prescribed time, date 
and place by the official/Tender Opening Committee, to be nominated 
by the CFA in advance. The authorized representatives, who intend to 
attend the tender opening, would be required to bring with them letters 
of authority from the tenderers concerned.  
 
(b) The tender opening official/committee should announce the salient 
features of the tenders like description and specification of the goods, 
quoted price, terms of delivery, delivery period, discount if any, 
whether EMD furnished or not and any other special feature of the 
tender for the information of the representatives attending the tender 
opening. 
 
(c) After opening, every tender should be numbered serially, initialed, and 
dated on the first page by the official(s) authorized to open the tenders. 
Each page of the price schedule or letter attached to it shall also be 
initialed by them with date, particularly the prices, delivery period etc., 
which should also be circled and initialed indicating the date. Blank 
tenders, if any, should be marked accordingly by the tender opening 
 officials.   
(d) Alterations in tenders, if any, made by the tenderers, should be initialed 
with date and time by the official(s) opening the tenders to make it 
perfectly clear that such alterations were present on the tenders at the 
time of opening.  
 
(e) Wherever any erasing or cutting is observed, the substituted words 
should also be encircled and initialed with date and time to make clear 
that such erasing/cutting of the original entry was present on the tender 
at the time of opening. 
 
  
33 
(f) The tender opening official(s) should prepare a list of the 
representatives attending the tender opening and obtain their 
signatures on the list. The list should contain the representatives’ 
names and the corresponding tenderers’ names and addresses. The 
authority letters brought by the representatives should be attached with 
this list. This list should be signed by both the tender opening official(s) 
with date and time. 
 
(g) An on-the-spot report containing the names of the tenderers (serial 
number wise) salient features of the tenders, as read out during public 
opening of tenders should be prepared by the tender opening official(s) 
duly signed by them with date and time. 
 
(h) The tenders, which have been opened, the list of the representatives 
attending the tender opening and the on-the spot report should be 
handed over to the nominated officer of the procuring agency and 
acknowledgement obtained for the same. 
 
4.11.2 Opening of tenders under two bid system:  The procedure laid down in 
the preceding paragraph should be followed mutatis mutandis under two 
bid system also but only the technical bids should be opened in the first 
instance. Commercial bids of only QR-compliant tenderers should be 
opened only after evaluation of the technical bids and approval of the TEC 
report by the CFA. The commercial bids of other tenderers, who are not 
found to comply with the QRs as above, will be returned to the tenderers, 
in sealed and unopened condition as received.  
 
4.12 Evaluation of Technical Bids 
4.12.1 Opening of Technical Bids: Where quotations are invited as separate 
technical and commercial bids, initially only the technical bids are to be 
opened in the presence of the tenderers or their duly authorized 
representatives. 
 
4.12.2 Evaluation of Technical Bids: After opening of the technical bids, 
technical evaluation is to be carried by a duly appointed Technical 
 Evaluation Committee (TEC). 
4.12.3  Technical Evaluation Committee (TEC): TEC, wherever formed, should 
invariably have representatives of the user, designated inspecting agency, 
maintenance agency, procurement agency and CFA, apart from the 
Chairman. Finance representative need not be associated with the TEC. 
 
4.12.4 Objective of the TEC: The main objective of the TEC is to prepare 
technical matrix showing how the technical parameters of bids received 
compare with the parameters mentioned in the tender document/RFP. If 
the offers conform to essential parameters they should be accepted.    
  
34 
 
4.12.5 Preparation of Compliance Report by TEC: The TEC should prepare a 
compliance statement bringing out the extent of variations and differences, 
if any, in the technical characteristics of the equipment/ tendered item(s) 
offered by various vendors with reference to QRs and compliance or non-
compliance with the essential parameters. If considered necessary, the 
TEC may invite those vendors who meet essential parameters for 
technical presentation/clarification.  
 
4.12.6 Format of the TEC Report: The TEC report should be prepared in the 
format as given at Form DPM-24. The following aspects should be kept in 
mind by the TEC: 
 
(a) The basic profile/character of technical offer must not be permitted to 
be changed. 
 
(b) Opportunity for revision of minor technical details should be accorded 
to all vendors in equal measure to ensure fair play. 
 
(c) 
No extra time should be given to any vendor to modify his offer to 
make it QR compliant. 
 
(d) Original commercial quotes must remain firm and fixed and no 
loading/unloading in price should be permitted during TEC’s 
discussion with the vendor.  
 
(e) No conditional offer should be accepted which is not in conformity 
with the specifications mentioned in the RFP. 
 
4.12.7 Mandate of the TEC as regards commercial aspects: The TEC is not 
authorized to discuss commercial aspects of the case.  However, the TEC 
should prepare a compliance statement in respect of commercial terms 
and conditions, such as bid security, warranty, etc., included in the 
technical bid as per the RFP.  
 
4.12.8 Association of IFA: Whenever two bid system of tendering is followed, 
technical evaluation of the bid becomes a vital step not only for 
ascertaining conformity of the technical bids with the technical 
specifications mentioned in the tender, but also to bring all bidders on a 
level playing field in respect of qualitative requirements. While technical 
evaluation is to be carried out by the TEC and integrated finance need not 
be associated at this stage, CFA may, if considered necessary, evolve a 
 system of associating the IFA or his representative in examination of the 
 
  
35 
TEC Report in regard to compliance with the commercial terms and 
conditions before opening of the price bid. TEC report, once finalized, 
should be sent to CFA for acceptance. 
 
4.12.9 Approval by the CFA: The TEC report should be approved by the 
respective CFA. TEC report may be accepted by Defence Secretary and 
Special/Additional Secretary in those cases where Raksha Mantri and 
Defence Secretary respectively are the CFAs. 
 
4.12.10 QR-compliant Offers: Those offers which meet the essential 
parameters as per the TEC report, duly approved by the CFA, should be 
considered by the Commercial Negotiation Committee (CNC) which, in 
turn, should evolve methods for benchmarking of price and holding 
internal meetings to finalize approach for conducting negotiations with the 
L1 vendor, if considered necessary by the CFA, in consultation with the 
IFA where powers are to be exercised with the concurrence of integrated 
finance. 
 
4.12.11 Revised Commercial Bids in Two Bid System: In case of procurement 
involving two-bid system, it may not be practicable to incorporate all 
possible details in the technical specification(s), thereby requiring 
elaborations/clarifications during technical discussion.  This may 
necessitate submission of revised commercial bids consequent upon 
discussion during TEC/CNC. If the original price bids have not been 
opened, it would be advisable to give equal opportunity to all technically 
acceptable vendors to give their revised commercial bids in a sealed 
cover.  The CNC would take into account the revised commercial bids to 
arrive at L1. 
 
4.12.12 CFA’s Approval for Obtaining Revised Commercial Bids: Before 
calling for revised commercial bids where original price bids have not been 
opened, approval of CFA should invariably be taken, after consulting 
integrated finance, where required as per delegation of financial powers. It 
is absolutely essential to give equal opportunity to all qualified vendors. 
 
4.13 Evaluation of Commercial Bids 
 
 
4.13.1  Preparation of the Comparative Statement of Tenders: After opening        
of the commercial bids (of QR-compliant tenderers in the case of two bid 
system and after approval of the TEC report by the CFA), the procuring 
agency should prepare a comparative statement of tenders (CST). The 
comparative statement of tenders should be prepared with due care 
showing each element of cost (basic cost, taxes, levies, etc.) separately 
against each tenderer. The CST should be prepared soon after opening of 
the commercial bids and got vetted by the IFA as to its correctness, where 
  
36 
financial powers are to be exercised with the concurrence of integrated 
finance.  
 
4.13.2 Commercial Evaluation: Evaluation of commercial bids is the core 
activity in any purchase decision. If the correct evaluation of quoted rates, 
freight, insurance, taxes, duties and other expenses involved is not carried 
out as per the criteria incorporated in the RFP, purchase decision may 
become deficient and faulty. Detailed guidelines on establishing 
reasonability of prices and ranking of bids are contained in Chapter 13 of 
this Manual.  
  
4.13.3 Commercial Negotiations: It is not mandatory to hold commercial 
negotiations in each case, particularly in open and limited tender cases, 
where the response has been substantial and the L1 price is found to be 
very close to the reasonable price, if such an assessment had been 
carried out prior to opening of the commercial bids. However, commercial 
negotiation may become necessary to ensure that the interest of the State 
is fully protected and the price paid is reasonable. Commercial 
negotiations are invariably conducted in case of single tender situations, 
including PAC cases, or when price is considered high with reference to 
assessed reasonable price, irrespective of the nature of tendering. Such 
negotiations are invariably conducted by a duly appointed Commercial 
Negotiation Committee (CNC), which should invariably include a finance 
member, unless the negotiation is carried out by the committee CFA itself.  
 
4.13.4 Composition of CNC: Apart from the Chairman, there should be 
representatives of the User, Integrated Finance, designated Inspecting 
Agency, Maintenance Agency, Directorate concerned with post-contract 
management and the CFA, wherever applicable.  CFA may nominate any 
other member, like a costing expert, in case of high value single vendor 
 offers while constituting the CNC. 
4.13.5 Chairman of the CNC: The CNC may be headed by an officer one rank 
below that of the CFA. The CNC may be headed by a Joint Secretary 
where Raksha Mantri or Defence Secretary is the CFA. The CFAs in the 
Ministry of Defence may also authorize an officer from the Services 
Headquarters to be the chairman of a CNC, particularly in those cases 
where the proposal was initially processed under the delegated powers 
but on opening of the tenders the cost was found to have exceeded the 
financial powers delegated to the CFAs in the Services Headquarters. 
 
4.13.6 Price Reasonableness: The basic objective of the   CNC is   to establish 
reasonableness of price being paid by the Government. This is a complex 
 task and many factors need to be considered. Detailed guidelines are  
  
37 
contained in Chapter 13 of this manual. However, factors like the last 
purchase price (LPP), movement of price indices, the market intelligence 
regarding cost of the item or similar items, material composition, cost 
analysis of raw materials, technological complexities involved, whether the 
items are of current production or otherwise, maintenance requirements, 
requirement of spares and warrantee etc. need to be considered while 
examining price reasonableness.  
 
4.13.7  Responsibility of the CNC: Wherever negotiations are conducted by the 
CNC, minutes of the CNC meetings should be recorded clearly and 
expeditiously. CNC should determine L1 and make unambiguous and 
specific 
recommendations 
giving 
reasons 
for 
making 
the 
recommendations. Detailed record of discussions regarding compliance 
with tendered QRs, price and contract clauses held during the CNC 
should be prepared and placed on record in the form of minutes of the 
meeting.  All the members of the CNC should sign the minutes.  
 
4.13.8 Acceptance of CNC’s recommendations: The recommendations of the 
CNC should be processed on file by the Procuring Agency for the 
approval of the CFA with the concurrence of the IFA, wherever required as 
per the delegation of powers.  
 
 4.14 Lack of Competition 
4.14.1  Lack of competition. The following situations would imply lack of 
         competition: 
(a) 
The number of acceptable offers is less than two. 
 
(b) 
Ring prices have been quoted by all tenderers (Cartel 
formation). 
 
(c) 
The product of only one manufacturer has been offered by 
all the tenderers irrespective of the number of quotations. 
 
(d) 
Store under purchase is chronically in short supply against 
which the number of acceptable offers never exceeds two. 
 
 4.15 Resultant Single Vendor Situation 
4.15.1 Action to be Taken in Resultant Single Vendor Situations: There are 
cases when only a single quote or a single valid acceptable quote is 
received even against LTE or OTE.  This situation may arise in single bid 
tendering as well as in two-bid tendering before or after technical 
evaluation. This results in a single vendor situation indicating lack of 
 competition.  In such situations, the following aspects will be examined: 
  
38 
(a) Whether all necessary requirements such as standard tender 
enquiry conditions, industry-friendly specifications, wide publicity, 
sufficient time for formulation of tenders had been taken care of 
while issuing the RFP; 
 
(b) Whether the RFP had been properly dispatched and duly received 
by the prospective vendors to whom these were sent.  
 
(c) Whether the SQRs, particularly in the LTE cases, could be 
reformulated and made more broad based to generate wider 
competition. 
 
(d) Whether time and criticality of requirement permits reformulation 
of the SQRs. 
 
If the examination reveals that (a) and (b) had been complied with and (c) 
an (d) are not feasible, the proposal may be processed further treating it 
as a case of OTE or LTE as the case may be with the approval of the 
CFA. In case, however, there is any doubt about the tendering process or 
it is considered feasible to consider reformulation of SQRs without 
compromising on operational requirement, the RFP should be retracted 
and re-issued after rectifying the deficiencies and/or reformulating the 
SQRs.   
 
 4.16 Re-tendering 
4.16.1 Re-tendering:  Re-tendering may be recommended by the CNC and 
approved by the CFA with the concurrence of integrated finance, where 
original sanction was accorded with the concurrence of integrated finance, 
with utmost caution, generally under the following circumstances: 
  
(a) Offer(s) do not conform to qualitative requirements and other terms 
and conditions set out in the RFP. 
 
(b) There are major changes in specifications and quantity, which may 
have considerable impact on the price. 
 
(c) Prices quoted are unreasonably high with reference to assessed 
reasonable price or there is evidence of a sudden slump in prices after 
receipt of the bids.  
 
(d) Where there is lack of competition and there are clear and reasonable 
grounds to believe that the lack of competition was due to restrictive 
specifications, which did not permit many vendors to participate. In 
such cases, which should, however, be rare as the specifications 
should normally be formulated with due care and after pre-bid 
conference, wherever required, CFA should consider if there is a 
  
39 
possibility of reviewing the specifications to facilitate wider and 
 adequate competition.   
4.16.2 Withdrawal of offer by L1: In case the lowest tenderer withdraws his 
offer, re-tendering should be resorted to as per the instructions issued by 
the Central Vigilance Commission. While retendering RFP may not be 
issued to the vendor who had backed out and EMD, if any, of such a firm 
should be forfeited.  
 
4.16.3 Procurement of bare minimum quantity in case of re-tendering: In 
cases 
where 
it 
is 
decided 
to 
resort 
to 
re-tendering 
due 
to 
unreasonableness of the quoted rates but the requirement is 
urgent/inescapable and re-tendering for the entire quantity is likely to 
delay the availability of the item(s) jeopardizing the essential operations, 
maintenance and safety, negotiation may be held with the L1 bidder for 
supply of a bare minimum quantity. The balance quantity should, however, 
be procured expeditiously through re-tender, following the normal 
tendering process. 
 
 4.17 Signing of Contract/Placing of Supply Order 
4.17.1 Signing of Contracts/Placing of Supply Orders: Once the CNC 
recommendations are accepted by the CFA or approval accorded by the 
CFA in those cases in which no CNC is held, the contract should be 
signed or the supply order placed, as the case may be, immediately. It 
must be ensured that the contract/supply order is as per the approved 
terms and conditions and the rates are correctly shown as finally 
negotiated and accepted by the CFA. Contracts/supply orders should be 
vetted by the IFA, wherever required as per delegation of financial powers, 
prior to acceptance of the purchase proposal by the CFA. Copies of the 
contract/supply order should be sent to all concerned, including the IFA, 
the audit authority and the paying authority, and their acknowledgement 
obtained. The format for Contract and Supply Order is given in Appendix E 
and D respectively. 
 
 4.18 Cartel Formation / Pool Rates 
4.18.1 Cartel Formation/Pool Rates: Sometimes a group of tenderers quote 
identical rates against a rate contract tender. Such Pool/Cartel formation is 
against the basic principle of competitive bidding and defeats the very 
purpose of open and competitive tendering system. Such practices should 
be severely discouraged with strong measures. Suitable administrative 
actions like rejecting the offers, reporting the matter to Registrar of 
Companies, MRTP Commission, National Small Industries Corporation 
etc. should be initiated against such firms, on case to case basis, as 
decided by the competent authority. Ministries/ Departments may also 
  
40 
examine the desirability of bringing such unhealthy practice to the notice 
of the concerned trade associations like FICCI, ASOCHAM, NSIC, etc. 
requesting them, inter alia, to take suitable strong action against such 
firms. New firms should also be encouraged to get themselves registered 
for the subject goods/services to break the monopolistic attitude of the 
firms forming cartels. All requests for making reference to outside 
agencies, such as Registrar of Companies or trade associations, are to be 
made to the Ministry of Defence. 
 
4.19 Procedure to be Followed for Procurement of Stores Involving 
 Validation/Testing 
4.19.1 Circumstances in Which the Procedure is to be Followed: Due to 
constant 
changes 
in 
technology, 
various 
weapons, 
equipments, 
ammunition, etc., which are already in service, need to be replaced by 
newer variants or upgraded/refurbished/re-equipped/modified/ overhauled 
to incorporate advancements in technology. This may necessitate 
validation 
trials/testing 
of 
upgraded/refurbished/re-equipped/modified 
equipment, if considered necessary by the Service Headquarters 
concerned. The procedure set out in this paragraph would be applicable to 
cases processed at the level of the Ministry of Defence/Service 
Headquarters only and should be suitably indicated while seeking AON. 
Such cases will not be treated as new introduction into Service. 
 
4.19.2  Categories of Cases: The cases to be processed under the provisions of 
  this paragraph would generally fall into the following category: 
 
a) 
Procurement of upgraded new versions of equipment, ammunition, 
vehicles, etc., which are classified as stores that can be procured from the 
revenue head, provided these conform to the existing laid down QRs and 
meet the prescribed performance parameters or certain enhanced 
parameters which have been incorporated as an amendment to the 
 existing QRs.  
  b) 
Upgradation, refurbishment, re-equipment, modification, Technical 
Life Extension, Overhaul, etc. of weapon platforms/systems/aggregates 
which can be carried out under the provisions of this Manual and as per 
the existing orders. The upgradation, refurbishment, re-equipment, 
modification, overhaul, etc. may be carried out at OEM’s premises abroad 
or in India, or partially in India and partially at OEM’s premises abroad, or 
even at a venue such as a Repair Overhaul Plant (ROH) where the 
requisite facilities are available, which may neither be in India nor at the 
OEM’s premises, provided it is certified by the OEM as having the 
technical capacity/capability.   
 
4.19.3 Procedure to be Followed for Procurement of Stores: For procurement 
of items mentioned in paragraph 4.19.2 (a) above, the Service 
  
41 
Headquarters should decide whether a validation process would be 
required and, if so, it should be indicated in the proposal. If such validation 
process (trial/testing) is considered necessary, the scope and duration 
thereof should also be finalized and indicated in the RFP. It should be 
mentioned in the RFP that the vendors which are found technically 
compliant would be required to provide specified quantities of the item on 
‘no-commitment-no-cost’ basis for trial evaluation/testing. The period 
within which the Vendor must submit the equipment/sample after being 
found technically complaint must be indicated in the RFP. The Technical 
evaluation will be a two-stage process. After the technical bids are 
opened, the TEC will short-list the vendors, which are technically 
compliant, and the TEC Report will be approved by the CFA. Thereafter, 
the technically compliant vendors will go through the process of 
evaluation/testing. The evaluation/testing should ideally be completed 
within a period not exceeding eight months from receipt of the 
equipment/sample from the vendors. The Validation Trial/Testing report 
will be again ratified by the TEC and approved by the CFA.   
 
4.19.4 Opening of Commercial Offer After Trial Evaluation/Testing: The 
commercial offer should be opened only after acceptance of the TEC/ 
Validation Trial/Testing Report of those vendors who have been 
recommended as technically compliant. The commercial offer should 
normally have a validity period of twelve months from the date of 
submission of the offer to ensure that the offer is still valid when the 
commercial bid is opened, commercial negotiations held and the order 
placed. A shorter validity period may be prescribed commensurate with 
the period of trial/testing. 
 
4.19.5 Dispensing with Trial Evaluation/Testing: For equipment available 
commercially off-the-shelf (COTS), which are upgrades of in-service items 
and have requisite IS/BIS or equivalent certification, the Service 
Headquarters may accept the equipment on the basis of self-certification 
by the vendor without going through the validation/testing process, 
provided it is confirmed by the QA Agency/AHSP or any other technical 
agency concerned. However, in such cases also TEC Report should be 
approved by the CFA.   
 
4.19.6 Procedure to be Followed for Upgradation, Refurbishment, Re-
Equipment, Modification, Technical Life Extension and Overhaul: For 
upgradation, refurbishment, etc., as mentioned in paragraph 4.18.2 (b) 
above, the vendors should be short-listed with the prior approval of the 
CFA and with the concurrence of integrated finance and the short listed 
vendors may be provided an opportunity to survey the weapon 
platform/systems, etc., which is to undergo upgradation/refurbishment/re-
equipment/ modification/Technical Life Extension/Overhaul prior to issue 
of the RFP. In case the upgrade, refurbishment, etc. is to be done in India, 
  
42 
the vendors should certify the capability and confirm the adequacy of the 
facility to the satisfaction of the Service Headquarters. If required, a 
Detailed Project Report (DPR) may be got prepared by the Service 
Headquarters after obtaining the AON but before issuing the RFP with a 
view to defining the scope and other technical details of the upgrade/OH 
programme.   
 
4.19.7 Special provisions to be made in the RFP: The RFP for upgradation, 
refurbishment, etc. should invite technical and commercial offers 
separately and may also have a provision for pre-bid conference prior to 
submission of the offers so that the technical and other issues could be 
clarified to vendors. The RFP should ask the vendors to specify the 
location of the plant/factory where upgradation, refurbishment, etc. will be 
undertaken and whether the vendor owns the facility. If the facility is not 
owned by the vendor, a certificate of agreement between the OEM and 
the plant owner would be required to be submitted by the vendors along 
with their offer. There should be a provision in the RFP that one lead 
equipment (where there are more than one number) will be tested by the 
vendor along with the representatives of the Service Headquarters (either 
in India or abroad) before the balance equipments are taken up for 
upgradation, refurbishment, etc. In case of a single weapon platform, there 
should be a provision for concurrent testing along with the upgradation, 
refurbishment, etc. 
 
4.19.8 Approval of the Final TEC Report and Opening of Commercial Offer: 
The TEC Report should be approved by the CFA and the commercial offer 
of the vendors who have been recommended as technically compliant 
should be opened only thereafter. This would be applicable in respect of 
cases covered by paragraph 4.19.2 (b). 
 
4.19.9 Validity of the Offer: The commercial offer should have a validity of up to 
eighteen months from the date of submission of the offer, depending on 
the period required for completing the technical evaluation, so as to 
ensure that the offer remains valid till the time the order is placed/contract 
signed. 
 
4.19.10 Assessment of the Vendor’s Facility: If required and considered 
necessary, a composite delegation of representatives of the User 
Department, CFA and integrated finance may be deputed to visit the 
plant/factory of the vendor finally recommended by the CNC to assess the 
capability/capacity of the selected vendors to carry out upgradation, 
refurbishment, etc. before commercial negotiations are finalized and 
approved by the CFA. 
    
  
43 
 4.20 Instruction to Bidders 
4.20.1 Instruction to Bidders: Subject to other specific provisions in this 
Manual, the broad instructions for the prospective bidders are as follows: 
 
(a) Eligibility: A firm registered with any Procurement/Registering 
Authority for the manufacture/supply of the tendered goods/services would 
be eligible to bid. An unregistered firm may get itself assessed for 
capacity/competency to manufacture/supply the tendered goods/services 
to become eligible to participate in tendering.  
 
(b) Clarification regarding contents of the Bidding Documents: A 
prospective bidder who requires clarification regarding the contents of the 
bidding documents shall notify the purchaser in writing and the purchaser 
will respond in writing to the clarifications sought not later than fourteen 
days prior to the date of opening of the tenders.  Copies of the query and 
clarification by the purchaser shall be sent to all prospective bidders who 
 have received the bidding documents.  
(c) Quotations to be submitted under original memos: Bids should be 
forwarded by vendors under their original memo /letter pad, inter alia, 
furnishing the TIN No., VAT/ CST No., Bank Address with EFT account 
No. and the complete postal and e-mail address of the firm.. 
 
(d) Amendment of Bidding Documents: At any time prior to the date of 
submission of bids the purchaser may, whether at his own initiative or in 
response to a clarification requested by a prospective bidder, may modify 
bid documents by amendments.  The amendments shall be notified in 
writing to all prospective bidders.  In order to afford prospective bidder a 
reasonable time to take the amendment into account in preparing their 
bids, the purchaser may, at his discretion, extend the deadline for 
 submission of bids. 
(e) Bid Validity: A bid shall remain valid for ninety days in case of single 
bid RFP and one hundred twenty days in case of two-bid system, unless 
otherwise specified, from the date of the opening of the tender.   A bid 
valid for shorter period can be rejected by the purchaser, as being non-
responsive.  In exceptional circumstances the purchaser may request the 
consent of the bidder for an extension to the period of bid validity.  Such 
requests shall be made in writing.  The bid security provided shall also be 
suitably extended.  A bidder accepting the request and granting extension 
shall not be permitted to modify his bid.  
   
(f) Late Bids: In the case of advertised tender enquiry or limited tender 
enquiry, late bids (i.e. bids received after the specified date and time for 
  
44 
receipt of bids) should not be considered and returned unopened to the 
bidder.  
 
(g) Modification and Withdrawal of Bids: A bidder may modify or 
withdraw his bid after submission provided that the written notice of 
modification or withdrawal is received by the purchaser prior to deadline 
prescribed for submission of bids.  A withdrawal notice may be sent by fax 
but it should be followed by a signed confirmation copy to be sent by post 
and such signed confirmation should reach the purchaser not later than 
the deadline for submission of bids. No bid shall be modified after the 
deadline for submission of bids.  No bid may be withdrawn in the interval 
between the deadline for submission of bids and expiration of the period of 
bid validity specified. Withdrawal of a bid during this period will result in 
 Bidder’s forfeiture of bid security. 
(h) Clarification regarding contents of the Bids: During evaluation and 
comparison of bids, the purchaser may, at its discretion, ask the bidder for 
clarification of his bid. The request for clarification shall be in writing and 
no change in prices or substance of the bid shall be sought, offered or 
permitted. No post bid clarification on the initiative of the bidder shall be 
 entertained. 
(i) Agents of the supplier: One agent cannot represent two suppliers or 
quote on their behalf in a particular tender enquiry.  Such quote should be 
rejected.  
 
 4.21 Instruction to the Purchase Officers 
4.21.1 Instruction to the Purchaser: Subject to other specific provisions of this 
 Manual, the broad instructions for the purchase officers are as follows: 
(a) Preliminary Examination: Purchaser shall evaluate the bids to 
determine whether they are complete; whether any computational errors 
have been made; whether required sureties have been furnished; whether 
essential documents such as the technical literature and Agency 
Agreement in the case of medical stores, etc., as specified in the RFP 
have been furnished; whether the bid documents have been properly 
signed; and, whether the bids are generally in order.  
 
(b)  Discrepancy in quoted price: If there is a discrepancy between unit 
price and the total price, the unit price shall prevail.  If there is a 
discrepancy between words and figures, the amount in words shall prevail.  
If a supplier does not accept the correction of the errors, his bid should be 
 rejected and the bid security may be forfeited. 
  
45 
(c) Trivial errors: Trivial errors such as omission to (i) enter the rates in 
words, (ii) initial any alteration in rates or (iii) sign both the tender and the 
schedules(s) may be corrected, initialed and dated both by the officers 
opening the tenders and signed and dated by subsequently by the 
tenderer.  
 
(d) Responsiveness of the bid: Prior to detailed evaluation, the 
purchaser should determine the substantial responsiveness of each bid to 
the bid documents.  A substantially responsive bid is the one which 
conforms to all terms and conditions of the bid documents without material 
deviations.  Deviations from or objections or reservations to critical 
provisions like Bid Security, Warranty & Guarantee, Applicable Law, 
Taxes and Duties and non-submission of documents such as valid Agency 
Agreement and technical literature in the case of medical stores should be 
 deemed to be a material deviation. 
(e) Evaluation and comparison of substantially responsive bids: The 
evaluation and comparison of responsive bids shall be done on the prices 
of the goods offered inclusive of all levies & taxes, such as VAT, Excise 
Duty and other charges such as Packing & Forwarding, Freight and 
Insurance etc., as indicated in the price schedule of the Bid document but 
exclusive of Octroi/Entry Tax, which is to be paid extra as per actual, 
 wherever applicable.  
(f) Award Criteria: The purchaser will award contract to the successful 
bidder whose bid has been determined to be substantially responsive and 
has been determined to be the lowest evaluated bid, provided further that 
the bidder is found to be technically, commercially and financially 
acceptable and whose goods have been type-approved/validated by the 
purchaser.  The purchaser reserves the right to counter offer price(s) 
 against price(s) quoted by any bidder. 
(g) Waiver of QRs/parameters: There should be no waiver of parameters 
after the issue of RFP as this may result in denial of opportunity to firms 
which could have met the revised essential parameters, had this been 
reflected in the RFP ab initio. This is particularly relevant in single 
vendor/resultant single vendor cases where waiver of essential 
parameters after issue of RFP and receipt of tenders would be prejudicial 
to the interest of other firms which might have submitted their bids as per 
the revised parameters but could not because of the essential parameters 
 mentioned in the RFP.  
(h) Pre-bid conference: To obviate the possibility of the RFP fetching no 
response, resulting in a single vendor situation or resulting in generation of 
limited competition, technical specifications should be firmed up in a pre-
bid conference in two-bid tender, particularly where the goods/services to 
  
46 
be procured are not available commercially off-the-shelf or are of complex 
and highly technical nature. No fresh commercial bids should be invited 
after opening of technical bids.

CHAPTER 5 
APPROVAL PROCESS AND CONCLUSION OF CONTRACT 
5.1 Procurement of Goods and Services 
5.1.1  Procurement of Goods: The need for procurement of goods may arise in 
the following circumstances: 
 
 
(a) to make up the deficiency of stores, which are authorized as per scales 
laid down in various Government letters, revealed as a result of 
provisioning reviews; 
(b) to build up authorized stocks; or 
(c) on account of non-scaled and not-in-vocabulary (NIV) items, which 
may include any kind of equipment, spares and other medical/ 
miscellaneous stores. 
 
5.1.2  Procurement of Services: The need for procurement of services may 
arise for any of the following reasons: 
 
(a) maintenance of any equipment/asset already held on charge; 
(b) performance of any task being performed in-house but considered 
appropriate for outsourcing;  
(c) need for engaging consultants; 
(d) any new function which can be performed economically by an outside 
agency. 
 
 5.2 Processing of Procurement Proposals 
5.2.1  Processing of Proposals for CFA’s Approval: All procurement 
proposals should be initiated in the form of a statement of case (SOC), 
which should clearly bring out all aspects of the proposal, including the 
justification/reason for procurement, quantity, cost, likely sources of 
supply, mode of tendering, etc. The format of SoC given in Appendix ‘B’ 
may be used for this purpose, with suitable changes as required. It needs 
to be kept in view that expeditious processing of the proposal depends on 
the comprehensibility and quality of the SoC. Draft NIT/RFP should also 
be submitted along with the SOC for approval of the CFA in consultation 
with integrated finance, where required as per the delegation of financial 
powers. 
 
5.2.2  Costing of Procurement Proposals: It is important that the procurement 
proposal is costed with due attention and care. The basis of costing must 
be placed on record. The level of approval by the CFA would depend on 
the entire cost of a proposal, inclusive of all taxes, levies and other 
charges. The procedure for costing is given in Chapter 13 of this Manual. 
  
48 
 
5.2.3  Processing of Proposals after CFA’s Approval:  After CFA’s approval, 
the procuring agency is required to go through the tendering action 
approval as per the provisions of Chapter 4 of this Manual and obtain 
CFA’s approval for the proposed procurement in consultation with 
integrated finance, where required as per the delegation of financial 
powers. 
 
5.2.4 Processing of Proposals Subject to Availability of Funds: A 
procurement proposal should normally be processed only if it figures in the 
Annual Procurement Plan (wherever such Plans are being prepared, 
irrespective of the nomenclature of the Plan) and subject to availability of 
funds. Availability of funds should be determined only after accounting for 
cash outgo during the relevant financial year on account of committed 
liabilities. 
  
5.2.5  Processing of Proposals Without Linking Them With Availability of 
Funds: Subject to the general rule that purchase proposals should be 
processed with due regard to availability of funds, a procurement proposal 
may be processed without linking it with actual availability of funds, if it is 
certified by the budget holder that there is reasonable certainty of funds 
becoming available by the time the proposal reaches the final stage of 
contracting/placing of supply order. In such cases, however, availability of 
funds would be determined after taking into account cash outgo on 
 account of the committed liabilities.  
5.2.6 Prior Concurrence of Integrated Finance: Competent Financial 
Authority’s approval is subject to prior concurrence of integrated finance, if 
required as per the delegation of financial powers. 
 
5.2.7  Ex-post Facto Financial Concurrence: There is no provision under the 
delegated financial powers to obtain ex-post facto concurrence of 
integrated finance. Such cases where prior concurrence is not obtained, 
though required as per the delegation of financial powers, would be 
treated as cases of breach of rules and regulations and referred to the 
next higher CFA for regularization. Such regularization will be subject to 
concurrence of IFA to the next higher CFA.           
 
5.2.8   Ex-post Facto Approval of the CFA: Where a proposal is approved, with 
or without the concurrence of integrated finance, by an authority not 
competent to sanction that proposal as per the delegation of financial 
powers, ex-post facto sanction may be accorded by the appropriate CFA 
with or without the concurrence of the IFA, as the case may be, as per 
delegation of financial powers. 
 
  
49 
5.2.9   Disagreement with the IFA:  In case of disagreement with the IFA, the 
CFA can overrule the IFA under intimation to the next higher CFA as well 
as the IFA giving reasons for overruling the financial advice. In such 
cases, it would be open to the IFA to take up the matter with the higher 
IFA and CFA or drop it. 
 
5.3 Acceptance of Necessity  
5.3.1 Acceptance of Necessity in Respect of Scaled Items: Acceptance of 
Necessity in case of scaled items would actually only entail vetting of 
quantities, assessment of physical requirement of various resources with 
respect to targets fixed and budget availability.    
 
 
5.3.2  Acceptance of Necessity In Respect of Scaled Items Whose Inventory 
is Computerized: In case of scaled items where inventories are 
maintained through automated systems and IFAs have been provided 
terminal on the same, IFA will vet the quantity on the automated systems 
based on data available on such automated systems, which would be 
deemed to be financial concurrence for acceptance of necessity also.  
 
5.3.3   Acceptance of Necessity in Respect of Non-Scaled and NIV Items: 
Acceptance of necessity in respect of non-scaled and NIV items would 
depend entirely on the justification provided for their procurement. It must 
be ensured that procurement of such items does not introduce a new 
practice and does not have the effect of changing the existing scales or 
policy.  
 
5.3.4 Acceptance of Necessity in Respect of Items Included in 
Procurement Plans: Some of the Services HQrs/Command HQrs and 
other establishments prepare annual procurement plans for revenue 
procurement. Where such a plan, irrespective of its nomenclature, is being 
prepared with the concurrence of Integrated Finance, necessity would be 
deemed to have been accepted in respect of each item included in the 
plan. No separate AON would be necessary in such cases. However, the 
AON would be for the item and not the quantities required. In such cases, 
however, Integrated Finance should be consulted for vetting of quantity, 
mode of tendering, identification of vendors in case of LTE/STE/PAC and 
vetting of draft RFP, where financial powers are to be exercised with the 
concurrence of integrated finance. 
 
Provided that if in any such case Integrated Finance wishes to make any 
observation regarding necessity, it may be done with the specific approval 
of the IFA concerned. Further processing of the proposal would, however, 
not be deferred pending resolution of the issue raised by Integrated 
Finance, unless the procuring agency considers it desirable to resolve the 
issue before proceeding further. Where it is decided not to defer further 
processing of the proposal, the observations made by Integrated Finance 
  
50 
would be brought to the notice of the CFA while seeking approval for the 
proposal. 
 
Provided further that AON of the CFA would need to be taken in 
consultation with the IFA, where financial powers are to be exercised with 
the concurrence of integrated finance, before the proposal is processed 
any further in case of non-scaled items which do not also figure in any 
approved procurement plan. 
 
 
5.4 Quantity Vetting 
5.4.1 Quantity Vetting in Respect of Scaled Items: Care should be taken to 
avoid purchasing quantities in excess of requirement to avoid inventory 
carrying costs. The IFA is supposed to vet the quantity indented/ projected 
for procurement of scaled items so as to ensure timely provisioning. In 
order to ensure that there is no infructuous provisioning, the IFA must 
have access to all inputs required to assess the basis of the projection of 
indented quantity. The calculation sheet showing the authorized scales, 
dues-in, dues-out, reserves, etc. must be made available to the IFA. In 
case an IT based management system is operational in the department, 
 the IFA is to undertake such vetting of quantity on the system itself  
5.4.2  Quantity Vetting in Respect of Non-scaled and NIV Items: While no 
fixed guidelines can be laid down for vetting of quantities of non-scaled 
and NIV items, it has to be ensured that purchase proposals of such items 
are based on the bare minimum inescapable requirement with due regard 
to economy of scales. Where financial powers are to be exercised with the 
concurrence of integrated finance, IFA should vet the quantity of such 
items if the procurement is proposed to be made under the delegated 
financial powers exercisable with the concurrence of integrated finance. If 
requirement of such items is found to be arising repeatedly, central 
procurement agencies should be intimated about the requirement. 
 
 5.5 Seeking Approval of the CFA 
5.5.1 Combining Various Stages of Processing:  It is not necessary that a 
proposal should be processed sequentially for AON, Quantity Vetting, 
financial concurrence, etc. A proposal, when initiated, should be complete 
in all respects so that all the aspects relating to AON, quantity vetting, 
costing, vetting of NIT/RFP, etc., could be examined simultaneously by the 
IFA, where required as per the delegation of financial powers.  
 
5.5.2  CFA’s Sanction: A sanction is a written authority from the CFA 
authorizing the expenditure. A sanction invariably indicates the reference 
to the authority under which expenditure is being sanctioned, the financial 
implication, the item for which the expenditure is approved and the budget 
code head. Whenever the final expenditure exceeds the sanctioned 
  
51 
amount, revised financial sanction of the CFA, in whose delegated powers 
the total expenditure would fall, is required to be obtained. The format for 
Sanction letter is given in Appendix K. 
 
5.6 Transparency, Competition, Fairness and Elimination of Arbitrariness in 
 the Procurement Process: 
5.6.1 Need for Ensuring Propriety of Procurement Process: All government 
purchases should be made in a transparent, competitive and fair manner, 
to secure best value for money. This will also enable the prospective 
bidders to formulate and send their competitive bids with confidence. 
Some of the measures for ensuring the above are as follows:  
 
(i) the text of the bidding document should be self-contained and 
comprehensive without any ambiguities. All essential information, 
which a bidder needs for sending responsive bid, should be clearly 
spelt out in the bidding document in simple language. The bidding 
document should contain, inter alia: 
 
(a) the criteria for eligibility and qualifications to be met by 
the bidders such as minimum level of experience, past 
performance, technical capability, manufacturing facilities 
and financial position etc.; 
 
(b) eligibility criteria for goods, indicating any legal 
restrictions or conditions about the origin of goods etc which 
may be required to be met by the successful bidder; 
 
(c) the procedure as well as date, time and place for sending 
the bids; 
 
 (d) date, time and place of opening of the bid; 
 (e) terms of delivery; 
(f) special terms affecting performance, if any. 
 
(ii) Suitable provision should be kept in the bidding document to 
enable a bidder to question the bidding conditions, bidding process 
and/ or rejection of its bid. 
 
(iii) Suitable provision for settlement of disputes, if any, emanating 
from the resultant contract, should be kept in the bidding document. 
 
(iv) The bidding document should indicate clearly that the resultant 
contract will be interpreted under Indian Laws. 
 
  
52 
 (v) The bidders should be given reasonable time to send their bids. 
(vi) The bids should be opened in public and authorized 
representatives of the bidders should be permitted to attend the bid 
opening. 
 
(vii) The specifications of the required goods should be clearly 
stated without any ambiguity so that the prospective bidders can 
send meaningful bids. In order to attract sufficient number of 
bidders, the specification should be broad based to the extent 
feasible. Efforts should also be made to use standard specifications 
which are widely known to the industry. 
 
 5.7 Responsibility of the CFA 
5.7.1  Responsibility of CFA in Purchase Decision: The CFA must consider all 
aspects of the case, including the quoted terms and conditions of the 
contract, delivery period, taxes and duties applicable, freight, insurance 
and other charges and the compliance to the specification before a 
purchase decision is taken. One of the important responsibilities of the 
CFA to ensure proper ranking of all offers so that the decision making 
process is totally transparent. The financial implication should be 
considered as the all-inclusive cost to the User on delivery to the 
designated consignee(s). Conditional offers and those with specifications 
not in conformity with the tendered specifications (Essential QRs) should 
not be considered. Before according sanction, concurrence of integrated 
finance should be taken wherever the powers are exercisable subject to 
such concurrence. 
 
5.7.2  Compliance with Procedures: While taking the purchase decision, the 
CFA needs to satisfy himself that proper procedures have been followed 
at various stages of procurement, purchase policies of the Government 
have been complied with and capacity and financial status of the firm have 
been checked. Purchase decisions should be taken through a formal order 
in a written form. 
 
5.7.3 Accountability: The decentralization of decision making mechanism and 
delegation of financial powers are aimed at facilitating faster decision 
making and obtaining best value for money. However, the delegation of 
powers also implies ‘authority with accountability’. The CFA approving the 
expenditure must ensure financial propriety and probity, transparency and 
fair play as well as   optimum utilization of resources. The designated CFA 
and all members of committee CFA are accountable for all decisions taken 
by them while approving any measure involving Government funds. This 
accountability is unconditional and absolute.  
  
53 
 
 5.8 Time frame 
5.8.1 Need for Expeditious Processing: It is imperative that the procurement 
process is fully responsive to the need of the Defence Services and other 
departments and facilitates expeditious procurement so that requirements 
are met on time. It is, therefore, essential that all prescribed activities are 
undertaken expeditiously and advice rendered within a specified time 
frame.    
 
5.8.2  Time Frame:  The time frame as given in Appendix ‘A’ is suggested for all 
activities in the procurement process to ensure that the bids are finalized 
within validity period.  In case the prescribed time frame cannot be adhered 
to in any specific case, suitable extension of validity of the bids should 
invariably be asked for well in time.

CHAPTER 6 
 
CONTRACT 
 
 6.1 Law 
6.1.1 Elementary Law: The elements and principles of contract law and the 
meaning and import of various legal terms used in connection with the 
contracts are contained in the Indian Contract Act, 1872 read with the Sale 
of Goods Act, 1930. The law relating to redressal of disputes is laid down 
in the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. Some of the salient principles 
relating to contracts are set out briefly in this chapter. 
 
6.1.2 Applicability to Defence Procurement: Government contracts, including 
those for defence procurement, are governed by the same laws which are 
  applicable to contracts between private parties.   
 6.2   Elementary Legal Practices 
6.2.1  What is a Contract?: The proposal or offer when accepted is a promise, a 
promise and every set of promises forming the consideration for each 
other is an agreement, and an agreement if made with free consent of 
parties competent to contract, for a lawful consideration and with a lawful 
object is a contract. 
  
6.2.2  Proposal or Offer: When one person signifies to another his willingness to 
do or to abstain from doing anything, with a view to obtaining the assent of 
the other to such act or abstinence, he is said to make a proposal or offer. 
In a sale or purchase by tender, the tender signed by the tenderer is the 
proposal. The invitation to tender and instructions to tenderers do not 
  constitute a proposal. 
6.2.3  Acceptance of the Proposal: When the person to whom the proposal is 
made signifies his assent thereto, the proposal is said to be accepted. A 
 proposal when accepted becomes a promise. 
6.2.4 Which agreements are Contracts?: An agreement is a contract 
enforceable by law when the following are satisfied. A defect affecting any 
 of these renders a contract un-enforceable. 
(a) Competency of the parties 
(b) Freedom of consent of both parties 
(c) Lawfulness of consideration 
(d) Lawfulness of object 
  
55 
 
 6.3 Competency of Parties  
6.3.1  Who Can Enter Into Contract?: Under law any person who has attained 
majority and is of sound mind or not debarred by law to which he is 
subject, may enter into contracts. It, therefore, follows that minors and 
persons of unsound mind cannot enter into contracts nor can insolvent 
person do so. 
 
6.3.2 Categories of Parties to the Contract: Categories of persons and bodies 
who are parties to the contract may be broadly sub-divided under the 
 following heads: - 
(a) Individuals 
(b) Partnerships 
(c) Limited Companies 
(d) Corporations other than limited companies 
 
6.3.3 Contracts with Individuals: Individuals tender either in their own name or 
in the name and style of their business. If the tender is signed by any 
person other than the concerned individual, the authority of the person 
signing the tender on behalf of another must be verified and a proper 
power of attorney authorizing such person should be insisted on. In case, 
a tender is submitted in a business name and if it is a concern of an 
individual, the constitution of the business and the capacity of the 
individual must appear on the face of the contract and the tender signed 
by the individual himself as proprietor or by his duly authorized attorney. 
 
6.3.4 Contracts with Partnerships: A partnership is an association of two or 
more individuals formed for the purpose of doing business jointly under a 
business name. It is also called a firm. It should be noted that a 
partnership is not a legal entity by itself, apart from the individuals 
constituting it. A partner is the implied authority to bind the firm in a 
contract coming in the purview of the usual business of the firm. The 
implied authority of a partner, however, does not extend to enter into 
arbitration agreement on behalf of the firm. While entering into a contract 
with partnership firm care should be taken to verify the existence of 
consent of all the partners to the arbitration agreement.  
 
6.3.5 Contracts with Limited Companies: Companies are associations of 
individuals registered under Companies Act in which the liability of the 
members comprising the association is limited to the extent of the shares 
held by them in such companies. The company, after its incorporation or 
registration, is an artificial legal person, which has an existence quite 
distinct and separate from the members of shareholders comprising the 
same. A company is not empowered to enter into a contract for purposes 
not covered by its memorandum of association; any such agreement in 
  
56 
excess of power entered into the company is void and cannot be enforced. 
Therefore, in cases of doubt, the company must be asked to produce its 
memorandum for verification or the position may be verified by an 
inspection of the memorandum from the office of the Registrar of 
Companies before entering into a contract. Normally, any one of the 
Directors of the company is empowered to present the company. Where 
tenders are signed by persons other than Directors or authorized 
Managing Agents, it may be necessary to examine if the person signing 
the tender is authorized by the company to enter into contracts on its 
behalf. 
 
6.3.6  Corporation other than Limited Companies: Associations of individuals 
incorporated under statutes such as Trade Union Act, Cooperative 
Societies Act and Societies Registration Act are also artificial persons in 
the eye of law and are entitled to enter into such contracts as are 
authorized by their memorandum of association. If any contract has to be 
entered into with any one of such corporations or associations, the 
capacity of such associations to enter into contract should be verified and 
also the authority of the person coming forward to represent the said 
associations. 
 
6.3.7  Parties to Defence Contracts: The parties to the defence contracts are 
the President of India as the purchaser acting through the authority 
signing the Contract/Agreement/Purchase Order etc., and the supplier 
named in the contract. 
 
 6.4 Consent of both the Parties  
6.4.1  Consent of Both Parties:  Two or more persons are said to consent 
when they agree upon the same thing in the same sense. When two 
persons dealing with each other have their minds directed to different 
objects or attach different meanings to the language which they use, there 
is no agreement. The misunderstanding which is incompatible with 
agreement may occur in the following cases: - 
 
(a) When the misunderstanding relates to the identity of the other party to 
the agreement; 
(b) When it relates to the nature or terms of the transactions; 
(c) When it related to the subject matter of the agreement. 
 
6.4.2  Free Consent of the Parties: The consent is said to be free when it is not 
caused by coercion, undue influence, fraud, misrepresentation or mistake. 
Consent is said to be so caused when it would not have been given but for 
the existence of coercion, undue influence, fraud, misrepresentation or 
mistake. When consent to an agreement is caused by coercion, undue 
influence, fraud or misrepresentation, the agreement is a contract voidable 
at the option of the party whose consent was caused. A party to a 
  
57 
contract, whose consent was caused by fraud or misrepresentation may, if 
he thinks fit, insist that the contract shall be performed, and that he shall 
be put in the position in which he would have been if the representations 
made had been true. 
  
6.4.3 Consent Given Under Mistake:  In case consent to an agreement has 
been given under a mistake, the position is slightly different. When both the 
parties to an agreement are under a mistake as to a matter essential to the 
agreement, the agreement is not voidable but void. When the mistake is 
unilateral on the part of one party only, the agreement is not void. 
 
6.4.4 Mistake of Fact and Law: Distinction has also to be drawn between a 
mistake of fact and a mistake of law. A contract is not void because it was 
caused by a mistake as to any law in force in India but a mistake as to law 
not in force in India has the same effect as a mistake of fact. 
 
 6.5 Consideration 
6.5.1 What 
is 
Consideration? 
Consideration 
is 
something 
which 
is 
advantageous to the promisor or which is onerous or disadvantageous to 
the promisee. Inadequacy of consideration is, however, not a ground 
avoiding the contract. But an act, forbearance or promise, which in 
contemplation of law has no value, is no consideration and likewise an act 
or a promise, which is illegal or impossible, has no value. 
 
 6.6 Lawfulness of Object 
6.6.1  Lawfulness of Object: The consideration or object of an agreement is 
lawful, unless it is forbidden by law or is of such a nature that if permitted, 
it would defeat the provisions of any law, or is fraudulent or involves or 
implies injury to the fraudulent property of another or the court regards it 
as immoral or opposed to public policy. In each of these cases the 
consideration or object of an agreement is said to be unlawful. 
 
 6.7 Communication of an Offer/Proposal and Acceptance 
6.7.1 Communication of an Offer or Proposal: The communication of a 
proposal is complete when it comes to the knowledge of the person to 
whom it is made. A time is generally provided in the tender forms for 
submission of the tender. Purchaser is not bound to consider a tender, 
which is received beyond that time. 
 
6.7.2  Communication of Acceptance: A date is invariably fixed in tender forms 
upto which tenders are open for acceptance. A proposal or offer stands 
revoked by the lapse of time prescribed in such offer for its acceptance. If, 
therefore, in case it is not possible to decide a tender within the period of 
  
58 
validity of the offer as originally made, the consent of the tenderer firm 
should be obtained to keep the offer open for further period or periods. 
 
6.7.3  When 
is 
communication 
of 
Acceptance 
Complete? 
The 
communication of an acceptance is complete as against the proposer or 
offerer, where it is put in the course of transmission to him, so as to be out 
of the power of the acceptor, and it is complete as against the acceptor 
when it comes to the knowledge of the proposer or offerer. The medium of 
communication in government contracts is generally by post and the 
acceptance is, therefore, complete as soon as it is posted. So that there 
might be no possibility of a dispute regarding the date of communication of 
acceptance, it should be sent to the correct address by some authentic 
foolproof mode like registered post acknowledgement due, etc. 
 
6.7.4 Acceptance to be Identical with Proposal: If the terms of the tender or 
the tender, as revised, and modified, are not accepted or if the terms of 
the offer and the acceptance are not the same, the acceptance remains a 
mere counter offer and there is no concluded contract. It should, therefore, 
be ensured that the terms incorporated in the acceptance are not at 
variance with the offer or the tender and that none of the terms of the 
tender are left out. In case, uncertain terms are used by the tenderers, 
clarifications should be obtained before such tenders are considered for 
acceptance. If it is considered that a counter offer should be made, such 
counter offer should be carefully drafted, as a contract is to take effect on 
acceptance thereof. If the subject matter of the contract is impossible of 
fulfillment or is in itself in violation of law such contract is void. 
  
 6.8 Withdrawal of an Offer/Proposal and Acceptance 
6.8.1 Withdrawal of an Offer or Proposal: A tenderer firm, which is the 
proposer, may withdraw its offer at any time before its acceptance, even 
though the firm might have offered to keep the offer open for a specified 
period. It is equally open to the tenderer to revise or modify his offer. Such 
withdrawal, revision or modification must reach the accepting authority 
before the date and time of opening of tender. No legal obligations arise 
out of such withdrawal or revision or modification of the offer as a simple 
offer is without a consideration. Where, however, a tenderer agrees to 
keep his offer open for a specified period for a consideration, such offers 
cannot be withdrawn before the expiry of the specified date. This would be 
so where earnest money is deposited by the tenderer in consideration of 
his being supplied the subsidiary contract and withdrawal of offer by the 
tenderer before the specified period would entitle the purchaser to forfeit 
the earnest money. 
  
  
59 
6.8.2 Withdrawal of Acceptance:  An acceptance can be withdrawn before such 
acceptance comes to the knowledge of the tenderer. A telegraphic 
revocation of acceptance, which reaches the tenderer before the letter of 
acceptance, will be a valid revocation. 
 
 6.9 Signing, Acceptance and Stamping of the Defence Contracts 
6.9.1  Who can Sign the Defence Contracts? All defence contracts are in the 
name and on behalf of the President of India. However, the contract, after 
due approval of the CFA, may be signed by a staff officer, duly authorized 
by the CFA in writing. The specimen signature of such staff officer is to be 
sent to all concerned, including the paying and inspecting authorities. As 
for the contractor, the person signing the contract is deemed to have been 
authorized by the supplier. 
 
6.9.2  Acceptance of the Defence Contracts:  Any contract, when not signed 
by both parties, namely the purchaser and the supplier, is deemed to 
come into force with the acceptance of the tender as per mutually agreed 
terms and conditions contained in the RFP and the firm’s offer. However, 
in the case of supply orders, the firm should check the supply order and 
convey acceptance of the same within seven days of receipt of the supply 
order. If such an acceptance or communication conveying their objection 
to certain parts of the contract is not received within the stipulated period, 
the supply order is deemed to have been fully accepted by the firm. In 
case of foreign contract, normally both parties sign the document thus 
conveying their acceptance of the contract. 
 
6.9.3 Stamping of Defence Contracts: Under entry 5 of Schedule I of the Indian 
Stamp Act, an agreement or memorandum of agreement for or relating to 
the sale of goods or merchandise exclusively is exempt from payment of 
stamp duty.  
 
 6.10 Types of Contract and General Principles for Contracting 
6.10.1 Types of Contracts: Government contracts can be of many types 
depending on the nature of the item being procured, work to be executed, 
services required to be rendered and support to be provided.  The 
provisions contained in this Manual are not applicable to the contracts for 
works and projects. These will apply to all other types of revenue 
 contracts. The general types of contract could be as follows: 
(a) 
Purchase order for items of stores, spares or equipment. 
(b) 
Rate Contract. 
(c) 
Price Agreement. 
(d) 
Service Contract. 
(e) 
Annual Maintenance Contract (AMC)/Comprehensive Maintenance 
Contract (CMC) 
  
60 
(f) 
Consultancy Contract. 
(g) 
Development Contract. 
(h) 
Works Contract/Project. 
 
6.10.2  General Principles of Contracting: The following principles are laid 
down for the guidance of the authorities who have to enter into contracts 
or agreements involving expenditure from public funds: 
 
(a) The terms of contract must be precise and definite and there must be 
no room for ambiguity or misconstruction therein. 
 
(b) Standard forms of contracts should be adopted, wherever possible, 
and the terms of the contract should be subjected to close prior 
scrutiny. 
 
(c) As far as possible and where mandated, particularly if standard format 
of contract is not to be adopted, legal and financial advice should be 
taken in drafting of contracts and before they are finally entered into. 
 
(d) The terms of a contract, once the contract is concluded, should not be 
materially varied without the previous consent of the authority 
competent to enter into the contract as so varied. 
 
(e) No contract involving an uncertain or indefinite liability or any condition 
of an unusual character should be entered into without the previous 
consent of the competent financial authority. 
 
(f) Whenever practicable and advantageous, contracts should be placed 
only after tenders have been openly invited.  
 
(g) In selecting the tender to be accepted, the financial status of the 
individuals and firms tendering must be taken into consideration in 
addition to all other relevant factors. 
 
(h) Even in those rare cases where a formal written contract is not made, 
no order for supplies, etc., should be placed without at least a written 
agreement as to the price.  
 
(i) Adequate provision must be made in the contracts for safeguarding 
Government property entrusted to the service provider. 
 
 6.11 Changes in the Terms Of/Amendment to a Concluded Contract 
6.11.1 Changes in the Terms of a Concluded Contract:  No variation in the 
terms of a concluded contract should normally be made, unless the 
contract specifically provides for it, in which case this can be done with the 
specific written consent of the parties to the contract.  
  
61 
 
6.11.2 Amendment to a Concluded Contract:  Amendment to a contract 
already concluded may become essential in certain situations when either 
party to the contract requests for an amendment and the proposed 
 amendment is acceptable to other party to the contract. 
6.11.3 Enhancement in Rates: No enhancement in rates/prices should be made 
unless the contract specifically provides for it. Such situations may arise in 
those cases where the contract provides for price variation clauses or the 
change is due to variation in Excise/Custom Duties/other Government 
taxes & levies and the contract provides for payment of these duties on 
the basis of actual rates, provided the supplies are made during the 
original delivery period. Consultation with Integrated Finance in such 
cases would be required if the original contract was concluded with the 
concurrence of Integrated Finance or, after increase in value, the contract 
falls within the delegated powers of the CFA, exercisable with the 
concurrence of Integrated Finance. 
 
6.11.4 Vetting of Price Variation Clause: Financial Advisor should be consulted 
 for vetting of price variation clauses/exchange rate variation clauses.  
6.11.5 Imposition of LD While Granting Extensions: While granting extensions 
of delivery period on an application of the contractor, the letter and spirit of 
the application should be kept in view in fixing a time for delivery and it 
must be decided while granting extension whether it would be with or 
without imposition of Liquidated Damages. 
 
6.11.6 Liability on Account of Taxes etc in the Event of Grant of Extension 
of Delivery Period: While grating extension of delivery period, any 
increase in the taxes and levies would not be payable, unless the contract 
specifically provides for it or it is expressly agreed to with the concurrence 
 of the Integrated Finance. 
6.11.7 Consultation with IFA: All amendments to contracts, which have 
financial implications, including short closing and delivery period 
extensions (with or without LD) should be approved by the CFA in 
consultation with the IFA, where the original contract was concluded with 
the concurrence of integrated finance. 
 
6.11.8 Amendments of Minor and Non-financial Nature: Amendments of 
minor nature concerning Drawing No., Part Nos., etc., which do not have 
financial implication, may be approved by an authority one step below the 
contract approving authority, if such authority is specifically authorized by 
the CFA. 
  
  
62 
 6.12 Termination of Contract 
6.12.1  Termination of a Concluded Contract: A contract may be terminated in 
the following circumstances: 
 
(a) 
When the supplier fails to honour any part of the contract including 
failure to deliver the contracted stores/render services in time. 
 
(b) 
When the contractor is found to have made any false or fraudulent 
declaration or statement to get the contract or he is found to be 
indulging in unethical or unfair trade practices. 
 
(c) 
When both parties mutually agree to terminate the contract. 
 
(d) 
When the item offered by the supplier repeatedly fails in the 
inspection and/or the supplier is not in a position to either rectify the 
defects or offer items conforming to the contracted quality 
standards. 
 
 (e)  
Any special circumstances, which must be recorded to justify the 
cancellation or termination of a contract.  
 
 6.13 Contract Effective Date 
6.13.1 Contract Effective Date:  The contract effective date is normally the date 
on which the contract is signed by both the parties unless otherwise 
mutually agreed to and clearly indicated in the contract as per agreed 
terms and conditions.    
  
 ******* 
  
63 
CHAPTER 7 
CONDITIONS OF CONTRACT 
 7.1 Conditions of Contract 
7.1.1 Conditions of Contract: A contract is a legal document and must be 
governed by certain terms and conditions to protect the interest of both the 
parties to the contract. It is important that every purchase officer is not only 
thoroughly familiar with each conditions of a contract, but that he is also 
able to take appropriate and timely action to safeguard the rights and 
honour of the Purchaser. It is also desirable that the conditions of a contract 
are practical, fair and just for both the Purchaser and the Supplier. The 
conditions 
of 
contract 
become 
binding 
for 
both 
parties 
on 
signing/acceptance of the mutually agreed contract. 
  
7.1.2 Standard Conditions of Contract (SCoC): In order to facilitate clear 
understanding of the conditions of contract, a set of standard conditions, 
generally applicable to all contracts, is formulated and made available to all 
firms at the time of registration itself. It is desirable that the SCoC as given 
in part III of Appendix C are publicized on the Defence website also. The 
Request for Proposal format contains reference to the standard as well as 
special conditions in Part III & Part IV respectively of Appendix C that the 
bidders would be required to abide by. The contract must also include the 
standard as well as special conditions specific to a particular case, as 
mentioned in the RFP. The standard and special conditions of contract are 
included in the format of the RFP as well as the supply order and contract 
given in Appendices ‘D’ and ‘E’ respectively. 
 
7.1.3 Applicability of SCoC to Supply Orders: The Standard and Special 
Conditions of Contract are applicable to Supply Orders also as given in 
Appendix D. Acceptance of Supply Order by the Firms/PSUs is essential to 
make the same as legally valid document.  
 
7.1.4  Special Conditions of Contract: Special conditions of contract are 
supplementary conditions applicable to a specific tender and contract. 
Such conditions become essential particularly in cases of contract for 
supply of services or even equipment. Special conditions of contract are 
given in Part–IV of Appendix C, D, & E which can be included on  
case-to-case basis. In addition, there may be a need to stipulate 
conditions like stage inspection, acceptance trials, installation, setting to 
work, and commissioning or pre-defined stages of payment for services. 
Such conditions should be decided while processing the proposal for 
CFA’s approval and mentioned in the Request for Proposal as well as the 
contract/supply order.  
 
  
64 
  
 
 7.2 Applicability of Conditions of Contract 
7.2.1  Applicability of all terms and conditions: The formats of the RFP and 
the contract agreement contain all the standard and special conditions of 
contract. While the special conditions may be mentioned in the RFP and 
subsequently in the contract, as applicable in a particular case, all the 
standard terms and conditions should invariably be mentioned in the RFP 
and the contract. Minor changes in the text would be permissible, as long 
as such changes do not materially alter the context or import of the 
relevant article. CFAs would be competent to take a decision in this regard 
in consultation with Integrated Finance, wherever such consultation is 
required for sanctioning the proposal. Legal opinion may be sought, if 
considered necessary, before making any such alteration. However, 
wherever standard text of clause given in Part III of Appendix C, D & E are 
concerned, the text of such clauses should not be altered without seeking 
legal opinion. 
 
7.2.2 Amplification of the terms and conditions: The terms and conditions 
included in the specimen format of the RFP and the contract are self-
explanatory. However, some of the salient terms and conditions are also 
explained in the succeeding paragraphs for better understanding. 
  
 7.3 Effective Date of Contract 
7.3.1  Effective Date:  The effective date of commencement of contract should 
be invariably indicated in each contract as per agreed terms and 
conditions.  Normally, the date of signing of the contract will be the 
effective date of contract as given in Para 2, Part III, Appendix C. 
However, except when specifically provided otherwise in the contract. 
Where specifically agreed to by the parties to the contract, effective date 
may be the date on which any or the last of the following conditions, as 
applicable, is complied with:  
 
(a) 
Furnishing of the Performance Bond in the form of PBG by the 
Seller 
 
(b) 
Obtaining of the Export License for supply of stores by the Seller 
and a confirmation in writing sent to the Buyer within specified 
days of signing of the contract. 
 
(c) 
Receipt of Bank Guarantee for advance payment 
 
(d) 
Date of Issue of the End User Certificate. (The supplier should 
normally provide the End User Certificate within 30 days of the 
signing of the contract.) 
  
65 
 7.4 Payment of Advance: 
7.4.1 Advance Payment to Suppliers: Ordinarily, payments for services 
rendered or supplies made should be released only after the services 
have been rendered or supplies made. Therefore, no advance should be 
offered in the RFP.  However, it may become necessary to make advance 
 payments in the following types of cases: 
(a) Advance payments are demanded by firms holding maintenance 
contracts for servicing of air-conditioners, computers, other costly 
equipments, etc. 
 
(b) Advance payments demanded by firms against fabrication contracts, 
turnkey contracts, etc. 
 
Where it is decided to provide advance payment, the quantum should be 
incorporated upfront in the RFP.   
 
7.4.2 Quantum of Advance: Advance payment should not exceed fifteen 
percent of the contract value or the amount payable for six months in case 
of maintenance contracts. 
 
7.4.3  Relaxation of the Prescribed Ceilings: The ceilings mentioned above 
may be relaxed only with the approval of the Secretary (Defence Finance) 
and the Secretary of the concerned Department of the Ministry of 
 Defence. 
7.4.4  Stage/Part Payments: If stage/part payments are proposed to be made 
on achievement of milestones, it should be clearly mentioned upfront in 
the RFP with the approval of CFA and the concurrence of the IFA, 
wherever required as per the delegation of financial powers. 
 
7.4.5  Securing the Advance: While making any advance payment, adequate 
safeguards in the form of bank guarantee, etc., should be obtained from 
the firm. The format in which such guarantee is to be obtained is given in 
Form DPM-16. 
 
7.5   Price Variation Clause/Price Adjustment Clause 
 
7.5.1  Normally a contract should be  entered into on a fixed price basis. 
Nevertheless, in the fluctuating market conditions it may sometimes 
become necessary in the case of long term contracts to consider variable 
price quotes given by the suppliers. The following guidelines will be 
followed in cases where a price variation provision is sought to be 
 included in the contract:   
  
66 
 
(a) 
Price Variation Clause can be provided only in long-term 
contracts, where the delivery period extends beyond 18 months.  In 
short-term contracts, firm and fixed prices should be provided for.  
(Where a price variation clause is provided, the price agreed upon 
should specify the base level viz., the month and year to which the 
price is linked, to enable variations being calculated with reference 
to the price levels prevailing in that month and year.) 
  
(b) 
A formula for calculation of the price variations that have 
taken place between the Base level and the Scheduled Delivery 
Date should be included in this clause.  The variations are 
calculated by using indices published by Governments or 
Chambers of Commerce periodically.  An illustrative formula has 
been given in Part IV of Appendix ‘C’ for guidance. 
  
(c) 
The Price Variation Clause should also specify cut-off dates 
for material and labour, as these inputs taper off well before the 
scheduled delivery dates. 
  
(d) 
The Price Variation Clause should provide for a ceiling on 
price variations, particularly where escalations are involved.  It 
could be a percentage per annum or an overall ceiling or both.  The 
buyer should ensure a provision in the contract for benefit of any 
reduction in the price in terms of the Price Variation Clause being 
passed on to him. 
  
(e) 
The clause should also stipulate a minimum percentage of 
variation of the contract price above which price variations will be 
admissible (e.g. where resultant increase is lower than two per cent 
no price adjustment will be made in favour of the supplier). 
  
(f) 
Where advance or stage payments are made, there should 
be a further stipulation that no price variations will be admissible on 
such portions of the price, after the dates of such payment. 
  
(g) 
Where deliveries are accepted beyond the scheduled 
Delivery Date subject to levy of liquidated damages as provided in 
the Contract, the liquidated damages (if a percentage of the price) 
will be applicable on the price as varied by the operation of the 
Price Variation Clause. 
 
 
(h) 
No price variation will be admissible beyond the original 
Scheduled Delivery Date for defaults on the part of the supplier. 
  
(i) 
Price variation may be allowed beyond the original 
Scheduled Delivery Date, by specific alteration of that date through 
  
67 
an amendment to the contract in cases of Force Majeure or 
defaults by Government. 
  
(j) 
Where contracts are for supply of equipment, goods, etc., 
imported (subject to customs duty and foreign exchange 
fluctuations) and/or locally manufactured (subject to excise duty 
and other duties and taxes), the percentage and element of duties 
and taxes included in the price should be specifically stated, along 
with the selling rate of foreign exchange element taken into account 
in the calculation of the price of the imported item. 
 
 
 
The mode of calculation of variations in duties and taxes and 
Foreign exchange rates and the documents to be produced in 
support of claims for such variations should also be stipulated in the 
Contract. 
  
(k) 
The clause should also contain the mode and terms of 
payment of the price variation admissible. 
 
 7.6     Exchange Rate Variation (ERV) 
7.6.1  ERV Clause: This clause is only to be included in the contracts concluded 
with Defence PSUs, in case the delivery period exceeds one year from the 
date of contract which involves import content (foreign exchange). The 
offer should indicate the import content. In case DP is re-fixed / extended, 
ERV will not be admissible, if this is due to default of the supplier. Base 
exchange rate of each major currency used for calculating FE content of 
the contract is to be indicated. The base date for ERV to be admissible 
would be the contract date and variation on the base date can be given 
upto the midpoint of manufacture unless the firm has already indicated the 
time schedule within which materials will be exported by the firm. Other 
 conditions as above for price adjustment would be applicable.   
7.6.2   Documentation for Claiming ERV: The following documents would need 
to be submitted in support of the claim on account of ERV: 
 
(a) 
A bill of ERV claim enclosing worksheet. 
(b) 
Banker’s Certificate / debit advice detailing FE paid & Exchange 
rate. 
 
(c) 
Copies of import orders placed on the suppliers.  
(d) 
Invoice of supplier for the relevant import orders. 
   
  
68 
 7.7 Performance Security Deposit 
7.7.1  Performance Security: Performance Security deposit payable to the 
Purchaser is furnished by the Supplier in the form of a Performance Bank 
Guarantee (PBG) issued by a public sector bank or a private sector bank 
authorized to conduct government business, in the prescribed format 
within thirty days from the date of contract. At present, ICICI Bank Ltd., 
Axis Bank Ltd. and HDFC Bank Ltd. are the three private sector banks 
authorized to carry out government transactions. The performance 
security deposit is meant to compensate the Purchaser for any loss 
suffered due to failure of the supplier to complete his obligations as per 
the contract. Preferably, performance security is payable by the supplier at 
the rate of 10% of the contract value. PBG should remain valid for a period 
of sixty days beyond the date of completion of contractual obligations, 
including warranty. The BG is returned to the supplier on successful 
completion of all his obligations under the contract. In case the execution 
of the contract is delayed beyond the contracted period and the purchaser 
grants extension of delivery period, with or without LD, the supplier must 
get the BG revalidated, if not already valid. The format of the PBG is given 
in Form DPM-15.  
  
 7.8 Payment   
7.8.1 Payment Terms: Payment terms are of great importance both for the 
purchaser and the supplier as the cost of finance plays a very important 
role in deciding the cost of an item or service being contracted for.  
Normally, 95% of the contract amount is released against provisional 
receipt of the item at the consignee’s premises along with inspection note 
and other documents. Balance 5% is released after the stores have been 
properly checked and accounted for. Some suppliers prefer 100% 
payment after delivery and accounting, which may be accepted. In many 
cases, suppliers request for allowing part supply and corresponding part 
payment. Such requests can also be considered by the CFA for 
acceptance on merit of individual cases. 
 
7.8.2 Paying Authority: The specific office of the Principal Controller/Controller 
or the Unit Accounts Office, which would be responsible for making 
payment, should be clearly mentioned in the RFP and the contract.   
 
7.8.3  E-payments: It will be mandatory for the suppliers/vendors to indicate their 
bank account numbers and other relevant e-payment details so that 
payments could be made through ECS/NEFT/RTGS mechanism instead 
of payment through cheques. A copy of the model mandate form 
prescribed by RBI to be submitted by suppliers/vendor for receiving 
payments through ECS is given in Form DPM-11. The details given in the 
mandate form should also be incorporated in the supply order/contract. 
 
  
69 
7.8.4 Documents to be Submitted for Claiming Payment: The documents to 
be submitted for audit and payment depend upon the nature of 
procurement and the terms and conditions of a particular supply 
order/contract. However, essential documents that are required for audit 
and payment are as follows: 
 
(a) Documents to be Submitted to the Audit Authority Along With 
Advance Copy of the Supply Order/Contract: 
 
(i)

supply order/contract. 
 
[Note: Depending upon the peculiarities of the procurement being 
undertaken, documents may be selected from the list given above and 
specified in the RFP and supply order/contract.] 
 
 7.9 Delivery 
7.9.1  Delivery: Timely delivery as per the delivery period (DP) stipulation in the 
Contract/Purchase Order is one of the most important procurement 
objectives as timely availability of items is vital, particularly for the 
department of defence. The stores are considered to have been delivered 
only when these are handed over to the consignee after due inspection by 
the designated inspecting agency. Most contracts stipulate door delivery 
at the consignee’s end by road. In some cases, the stores are also 
despatched by rail, in which case the delivery is deemed to have been 
  
71 
made on receipt of RR and inspection note.  In certain cases where the 
contractor offers stores for inspection during the last few days of contract 
DP or on the last day of the contract DP, the inspector can inspect the 
store and sentence it as per standard franking clause. 
 
[As per the standard franking clause, the fact that the stores have been 
inspected after the delivery period and accepted by the inspectorate does 
not bind the purchaser, unless at his discretion he agrees, to accept 
delivery thereof. The stores are accepted without prejudice to the right of 
the Purchaser.]  
 
7.9.2  Correctness of the Quality and Quantity: On receipt at the consignee’s 
premises, the stores are checked for ascertaining the correctness of 
quantity, quality and documents. In case the stores are found deficient in 
any way, the consignee has the right to reject the stores even if these 
were inspected and cleared by the inspector.  
 
7.9.3  Failure to deliver within the DP: When the supplies do not materialize by 
  the stipulated contract delivery date, the purchaser has the option of:  
(a) 
Extending the delivery date with imposition of LD and denial 
clause, which implies denial of increase in price, taxes, 
duties, etc. taking place during the extended period. 
 
(b) 
Re-fixing the delivery date. 
 
(c) 
Canceling the contract and repurchasing the non-supplied 
quantity.   
 
7.9.4  Deciding the Course of Action in the Event of Failure of Supply: For 
deciding on these options the Procuring Authority has to balance the time 
factor required for making repurchase and whether the supply can be 
arranged earlier than the period of extension sought for at cheaper rates 
from alternative sources and in the latter case whether the indentor can 
reasonably wait to take advantage of lower trend in prices.  Extension 
shall be granted only where the CFA is convinced that supplier would 
come forward during extended DP. Detailed instructions are contained in 
chapter 12 of DGS &D Manual 1999. Suggested format for 
correspondence/amendment on this issue has been given in Forms DPM-
26, DPM-27, DPM-28 and DPM-29 for guidance.  
 
7.9.5  Maximum Period of Extension: The maximum period of extension of 
delivery that can be granted by the CFA under delegated powers should 
be such that the total period - the original delivery period plus the 
extension – does not exceed twice the original delivery period. Extensions 
beyond this period would require sanction of the Ministry of Defence.   
  
  
72 
 
7.10 Liquidated Damages (LD) 
 
7.10.1 Liquidated damages: Compensation of loss on account of late delivery 
where loss is pre-estimated and mutually agreed to is termed as the 
Liquidated Damage (LD). Law allows recovery of pre-estimated loss, 
provided such a term is included in the contract. For imposition of LD, 
there is no need to establish actual loss due to late supply. The legal 
 position with regard to claim for liquidated damages is as follows:   
(a) Whatever the quantum of the loss sustained, the claim cannot 
exceed the sum stipulated in the contract. 
 
(b)  Only reasonable sum can be calculated as damages, which in 
given situation may be less than the sum stipulated. 
 
(c)  What is a reasonable sum would depend on facts. 
 
(d)  Court may proceed on the assumption that the sum stipulated 
reflects the genuine pre-estimates of the parties as to the probable loss 
and such clause is intended to dispense with proof thereof. 
 
(e) The distinction between penalty and LD has been abolished by the 
Indian Contract Act and in every case, the Court is not bound to award 
more than ‘reasonable compensation’ not exceeding the amount so 
named. 
 
7.10.2  Quantum of LD: As a general rule, if the contractor fails to deliver the 
stores/service or any installment thereof within the DP or at any time 
repudiates the contract before expiry of such period, the CFA, without 
prejudice to the right of the purchaser to any other remedy for breach of 
contract, may recover from the contractor a sum equivalent to 0.5% of the 
prices of any stores which the contractor has failed to deliver within the 
period agreed for delivery in the contract, for each week or part thereof 
during which the delivery of such stores may be in arrears, where delivery 
thereof is accepted after expiry of the aforesaid period. The total damages 
shall not exceed value of 10% of undelivered goods. The LD cannot 
exceed the amount stipulated in the contract.   
  
7.10.3 Guidelines for levying of LD: The following guidelines would be followed 
while taking decision for imposition of LD: 
 
 
  
73 
 
Sr 
No 
Circumstances 
Quantum of LD 
1 
Delay in supplies resulted in 
actual/ demonstrable monetary 
loss and the Supplier was 
responsible for the delay  
Full LD as per the provisions of 
paragraph 7.8.2, subject to the 
LD not exceeding 10% of the 
value of the contract 
 
2 
Delay in supplies resulted in 
actual/ demonstrable monetary 
loss but the Supplier was 
responsible only for a part of the 
delay and the remaining part was 
beyond Supplier’s control 
 
Full LD for the period for which 
the Supplier was responsible 
for the delay, subject to the LD 
not exceeding 10% of the value 
of the contract 
3 
Delay in supplies resulted in 
actual/ demonstrable monetary 
loss but the entire delay was due 
to circumstances beyond the 
control of the Supplier    
 
LD may be waived in full 
4 
Actual/demonstrable monetary 
loss cannot be certified and no 
inconvenience has been caused 
LD may be waived in full 
  
7.10.4   Waiver of LD: Liquidated damages may be waived in full or part, as per 
the guidelines contained in the preceding paragraph, with the approval of 
the CFA and the concurrence of the IFA, wherever such concurrence is 
mandated as per delegation of financial powers. In all such cases, 
adequate reasons should invariably be recorded for waiving the Liquidated 
 Damages. 
7.10.5  Consequential Damages: Consequential damage is imposed over and 
above LD in case of time critical Turn-key Projects. Where considered 
necessary, it should be included in the RFP and the contract. 
  
 7.11 Arbitration 
7.11.1  Arbitration: If a dispute arises between the Purchaser and the Supplier 
and it does not get resolved through mutual discussions, the parties may 
agree for arbitration. MOD/CFAs should prepare a panel of arbitrators for 
selection by the Defence Secretary /CFA’s who appoint an arbitrator, 
whose decisions taken after due consideration of factors brought out by 
both parties are considered final. The option of approaching Ministry of 
Law for appointment of Arbitrator can also be exercised.  Services 
Headquarters have the power to appoint Arbitrators within their delegated 
  
74 
financial powers.  The standard Arbitration clauses are given in Forms 
DPM-7, DPM-8 and DPM-9. 
 
  
7.11.2 Appointment of Arbitrators through Court: There may be situations 
when either party approaches a court of law for appointing an independent 
arbitrator. Purchase officers must consult the Legal Advisor (Defence) and 
Government counsel in all cases of arbitration. 
 
 7.12 Force Majeure 
7.12.1 Force Majeure: Wherever considered necessary, this clause may be 
included in the RFP and in the Contract. In this context provisions of 
paragraph 10.9 of this Manual will apply, mutatis mutandis, to 
procurement from indigenous sources also, though this clause should be 
included in such contracts only if absolutely necessary. The standard 
  format of the clause is given in Part-IV of Appendix C. 
 7.13 Option Clause and Repeat Order Clause 
7.13.1 Repeat Order and Option Clauses: Provision for repeat order and option 
clause should not be made as a matter of course in the RFPs as these 
clauses have an impact on price. Either or both these clauses may be 
provided in the RFP only in exceptional circumstances, where the 
consumption pattern is not predictable, with the stipulation that while 
exercising one or both these clauses the overall ceiling of fifty percent of 
the originally contracted quantity will not be exceeded.  Repeat Order 
and/or Option Clause may be exercised more than once, provided 
altogether these orders do not exceed 50% of the original order quantity.  
 
7.13.2 Option Clause: Under this clause, the Purchaser retains the right to place 
orders for additional quantity up to a maximum of 50% of the originally 
contracted quantity at the same rate and terms of the contract. Such an 
option is available during the original period of contract provided this 
clause had been incorporated in the original contract with the supplier.  
Option quantity during extended DP is to be limited to 50% of balance 
quantity after original Delivery Period. This clause may be exercised in 
case of procurement from single vendor/OEM also subject to there being 
no downward trend in prices. However, in multi vendor contracts, great 
care should be exercised before operating the option clause.  
 
7.13.3 Conditions governing Option Clause: Against an outstanding indent for 
which acceptance of necessity has been approved by CFA, it may be 
advantageous to the Purchaser to exercise the option clause in 
accordance with the terms and conditions of contract.  The option clause 
may be exercised on approval of the CFA, within whose powers total 
value of original supplies plus value of the option clause falls, in 
consultation with IFA, where applicable as per the delegation of financial 
  
75 
powers, during currency of the contract. It should be ensured that there is 
no downward trend in the market prices. No fruitful result will accrue by 
floating fresh RFP when items are urgently required. If the contract also 
contains the repeat order clause, it may be kept in mind while placing 
order under the option clause that the total quantity under the option 
clause and the repeat order cannot exceed fifty percent of the originally 
ordered quantity.  
 
7.13.4  Repeat Order: Wherever considered necessary, provision may be made 
in the RFP and the contract for Repeat Order. A Repeat order against a 
previous order  may be placed at the same cost and terms and conditions 
as per the original order/contract with the approval by the CFA and 
concurrence of integrated finance, wherever required as per the 
delegation of financial powers. 
 
7.13.5 Conditions Governing Repeat Order: A Repeat Order may be placed 
subject to the following: 
 
(a) 
Items ordered against the previous order had been delivered 
 successfully. 
(b) 
Original 
order 
should 
not 
have 
been 
placed 
to 
cover 
 urgent/emergent demand. 
(c) 
Repeat Order is not placed to split the requirement to avoid 
 obtaining the sanction of the next higher CFA. 
(d) 
The original order should have been placed on the basis of lowest 
price negotiated and accepted by CNC, and not on the basis of delivery or 
 any other preference.  
(e) 
There is no downward trend in the price of the item. (A clear 
 certificate should be recorded to that effect.)  
(f) 
The requirement is for stores of identical nature/ specifications, 
nomenclature etc.  Minor improvements in spec(s) or phasing out of 
products due to obsolescence should not be precluded from the purview 
of repeat order but this aspect should be very carefully examined from the 
point of view of interchangeability of the product offered as an improved 
 substitute. 
(g) 
The repeat order is to be placed within six months from the date of 
completion of the supply against the previous order and it should be 
 placed only once. 
(h) 
The repeat order quantity is to be restricted to a maximum of 50% 
of last order quantity in case of indigenous and foreign procurement, 
  
76 
where the contract does not also include the option clause. In case of 
orders for small quantities (1 to 7), the Repeat Order quantity may be 
 rounded off to the next whole number. 
(i)       This provision may be exercised in case of PAC/Single vendor OEM 
also.  However, care should be taken before exercising this provision in 
 multi-vendor situation.  
(j)  
Where the contract also includes an Option clause, Repeat Order 
may be placed only for such quantity, which, along with the quantity for 
which Option clause may have already been exercised, does not result in 
the total quantity under the Option clause and the Repeat Order 
 exceeding 50% of the originally ordered quantity. 
(k)  
The CFA will be decided taking into consideration the value of the 
originally ordered quantity and the Option clause/Repeat Order quantity. 
 
 7.14 Risk and Expense Purchase 
7.14.1 Risk & Expense Purchase: Risk and expense purchase clause may be 
included in the RFP and the contract, if considered necessary. Risk and 
Expense purchase is undertaken by the purchaser in the event of the 
supplier failing to honour the contracted obligations within the stipulated 
period and where extension of delivery period is not approved. While 
initiating risk purchase at the cost and expense of the supplier, the 
purchaser must satisfy himself that the supplier has failed to deliver and  
has been given adequate and proper notice to discharge his obligations. 
Whenever risk purchase is resorted to, the supplier is liable to pay the 
additional amount spent by the Government, if any, in procuring the said 
contracted goods/ services through a fresh contract, i.e. the defaulting 
supplier has to bear the excess cost incurred as compared with the 
amount contracted with him. Factors like method of recovering such 
amount should also be considered while taking a decision to invoke the 
provision for risk purchase. A Standard Risk & Expense Purchase clause 
  is given in Part-IV of Appendix C. 
7.14.2. Risk and Expense purchase clause not mandatory: Risk purchase at 
the cost and expense of the supplier may not always be a practical 
proposition as it may not be feasible to enforce recovery without legal 
action. This clause is rarely invoked in case of import contracts for this 
reason. In such cases where the item is of proprietary nature or there is 
only one qualified firm to supply the items and there is a remote possibility 
of procuring the same item from an alternative source, it will be essential 
that instead of having risk and cost clause in the contract, the contract 
should have performance guarantee clause to cover any such default.  
 
  
77 
7.14.3 Alternative remedies to Risk & Expense Purchase Clause:  In case of 
foreign contracts, risk and expense clause is generally not applicable.  
The other remedies available to the purchaser in the absence of the Risk 
and Expense Clause are as follows:  
 
(a) 
Deduct the quantitative cost of discrepancy from any of the 
outstanding payments of the supplier. 
 
(b) 
Avoid issue of further RFP’s to the firm till resolution of the 
discrepancy. 
(c) 
Bring up the issue of discrepancy in all meetings with the 
representative of supplier. 
 
(d) 
Provide for adequate Bank Guarantee to cover such risks. 
 
(e] 
In case of foreign contracts, finally approach the Government of the 
Supplier’s country through the Ministry of Defence, if needed. 
  
 7.15 Apportionment of Quantity 
7.15.1 Apportionment of Quantity: In global and limited tender enquiry cases, if 
there is an apprehension that the L1 may not have the capacity to supply 
the entire requisite quantity, it should be mentioned in the RFP that the 
order may be placed on L2, L3 and so on for the balance quantity at L1 
rates, provided this is acceptable to them.  Even if there was no prior 
decision to split the quantities and it is discovered that the quantity to be 
ordered is far more than what L1 alone can supply, the order may be 
distributed as above among L2, L3, etc. at the L1 rate.  Where it is decided 
in advance to have more than one source of supply ( due to vital or critical 
nature of the item) the ratio  of splitting should be indicated in the RFP. 
 
 7.16 Acceptance of Excess or Short Deliveries 
7.16.1 Acceptance of Excess or Short Deliveries:  There may be occasions 
when excess or short supplies are made by the vendors due to various 
reasons like, exact multiples of the standard units of measure, or where it 
is difficult to mention exact weight in case of steel plates etc. A clear 
indication should be made in the RFP if this clause is to be applied in any 
particular case. These variations in supplies may be accepted with the 
approval of CFA, subject to the value of such excess/short supplies not 
exceeding 5% (five percent) of the original value of the contract. CFA will 
be determined with reference to the value of the original order plus 
excess/short supply. 
    
  
78 
7.17 Buy Back Offer 
 
7.17   Buy Back Offer: When it is decided to replace an existing old item(s) with 
a new item(s), a suitable clause should be incorporated in the RFP so that 
the prospective and interested bidders may formulate their bids 
accordingly. Depending on the value and condition of the old item(s) to be 
traded, the time as well as the mode of handing over of the old items to 
the successful bidder should be decided and relevant details in this regard 
suitably incorporated in the RFP. Suitable provision should also be made 
in the RFP to enable the Purchaser either to trade or not to trade the old 
item(s) while purchasing the new one(s). 
 
  7.18  Fall Clause 
7.18.1 Fall Clause: In cases where contracts have to be concluded with the 
firms, whose rate contract with DGS&D/other central procurement 
agencies has expired and renewal of RC has not taken place, a 'fall 
clause' should be incorporated in the Supply Order/Contract to the effect 
that during the currency of the Supply Order/Contract, in case rates are 
found to be lower on conclusion of rate contract, the lower rates as in the 
  rate contract shall be applicable.

CHAPTER 8 
 
RATE CONTRACT 
 
 8.1 General 
8.1.1 Objective: The basic objective of a procurement agency is to provide the 
right items of right quality and in right quantity, at the right place and right 
price so as to meet the requirement of the users. One of the ways to 
ensure this is to conclude Rate Contracts for all common user items which 
are regularly required in bulk by the users and whose prices are likely to 
be stable and not subject to considerable market fluctuations. A Rate 
Contract (RC) enables procurement officers to procure indented items 
promptly and with economy of scale and also cuts down the order 
processing and inventory carrying cost.  The RC system takes care of 
supply chain management and enables an efficient transaction both for 
the purchaser and the supplier. 
 
8.1.2 Definition: A Rate Contract (commonly known as RC) is an agreement 
between the purchaser and the supplier for supply of specified goods (and 
allied services if any) at specified price and terms & conditions (as 
incorporated in the agreement) during the period covered by the Rate 
Contract. No quantity is mentioned nor is any minimum drawal guaranteed 
in the Rate Contract. The Rate Contract is in the nature of a standing offer 
from the supplier firm. The firm and/or the purchaser is/are entitled to 
withdraw/cancel the Rate Contract by serving an appropriate notice on 
each other, of not less than thirty days. However, once a supply order is 
placed on the supplier for supply of a definite quantity in terms of the rate 
contract during the validity period of the rate contract that supply order 
becomes a valid and binding contract and the supplier is bound to supply 
 the ordered quantity. 
8.1.3 Price Agreement: While procuring goods and services, it may be 
expedient to enter into a Price Agreement (PA)/Fixed Price Quotation 
(FPQ) with the Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). The PA/FPQ 
may be finalized after due negotiation and market survey.  Such PA/FPQ 
may be normally valid for a period upto three years and may be extended 
further suitably with next higher CFA’s sanction.  
 
8.1.4  Types of Items Suitable for RC: The types of items which may be 
 considered for RC are: 
(a) 
Items required by several users on recurring basis and having clear 
specifications.   
 
(b) 
Fast moving items with short shelf life or storage constraints. 
  
80 
 
(c) 
Items with minimum anticipated price fluctuation during the 
currency of the RC. Items with high probability of considerable price 
fluctuation should not be considered to be covered by RC except 
for short term contract. 
 
(d) 
Items that take long gestation period to manufacture and for which 
there is only one source for manufacturing. 
 
8.1.5 Items already on DGS&D Rate Contract: No Rate Contract should 
normally be concluded for items in respect of which DGS&D Rate 
Contracts are already in place. If, however, it becomes necessary to enter 
into contracts for items which are already on DGS&D Rate Contract, the 
reasons for doing so should be recorded and CFA’s approval taken after 
consulting integrated finance.   
 
8.2 Authorities Competent to Conclude Rate Contract/Long Term Product 
 Support 
8.2.1  Authorities competent to conclude Rate Contracts: Rate Contract or 
Price Agreement for goods and services should be concluded only by the 
authorized Central and local Procurement Agencies. 
 
 
8.2.2  Long Term Product Support: The Price Agreement for long term product 
support should be concluded with the approval of the authorities to whom 
such powers have been specifically delegated. 
 
 8.3 Period of Rate Contract 
8.3.1  Period of RC:  A Rate Contract should normally be concluded for one 
year.  However, in special cases, shorter or longer period, not exceeding 
three years, may be considered. Any extension of the existing RC or 
conclusion of an RC beyond a period of three years would need the 
approval of the Ministry of Defence. 
 
8.3.2  Fixing of the Termination Period: As far as possible termination period of 
RC should be so fixed as to ensure that budgetary levies would not affect 
  the price and thereby frustrate the contracts.  
 8.4 Determination of the Competent Financial Authority to approve RC 
8.4.1 Competent Financial Authority: Value of anticipated drawal over a 
period of one year should be taken into account while determining the 
level of CFA for conclusion of Rate Contract/Price Agreement.  
 
  
81 
 8.5 Process of concluding Rate Contracts 
8.5.1  Estimate/Indent/Requisition: A Rate Contract can be concluded based 
on estimated annual requirements of various users under the authority 
processing an RC proposal. The contract concluding authority must 
scrutinize the estimates for their completeness in terms of authority for 
raising the indent, specification of the item, desired delivery schedule, 
packing and preservation, etc. Adequate budget provisions must be made 
and confirmed in the normal manner. 
 
8.5.2  Selection of Firms: Rate Contracts should be normally concluded only 
with the registered firms based on their capacity assessment by the 
designated Registering/Inspecting Agency.  In respect of new items being 
bought on Rate Contract for the first time, RC can be awarded to 
unregistered firms also on the basis of favourable technical capacity and 
financial capabilities. Past performance of a firm will be a major 
consideration while awarding a Rate Contract. The following aspects 
should normally be kept in mind:  
 
(a) No new RC should be placed with firms having backlog, which is 
likely to continue for major portion of the year. 
 
(b) Performance of the contractor for the last 3 years should be taken 
into consideration. 
 
(c) 
If the contractor does not have current RC, performance against 
earlier two immediate rate contracts should be considered.  
 
(d) If the RC holder is a defaulter in furnishing drawal report, this 
should be looked into, if the defaulter is bidding. 
 
(e) The minimum performance level / performance criteria should be 
specified in the bid documents. 
 
8.5.3  Price Negotiation: While concluding RC, it is preferable to conduct price 
negotiations by the CNC in order to obtain best value for money and also 
to clarify all aspects of the RC to avoid ambiguity and dispute at a later 
stage. All Rate Contracts and Price Agreements should be processed 
through the committee CFA or the CNC so as to ensure best value for 
money, quality assurance and transparency. Participation of finance 
member in all deliberations, particularly regarding the pricing and 
 conditions of contract, is mandatory.  
8.5.4  Signing of Rate Contract:  RC concluded for various wings of the MOD 
will be signed for and on behalf of the President of India. RC itself may be 
signed by the authority to whom powers to enter into RC are delegated or 
  
82 
an officer authorized to sign financial documents on his behalf, after CFA’s 
approval. 
 
 Conclusion of Parallel RC 
8.6.1  Parallel Rate Contracts:  In case it is observed that a single supplier does 
not have enough capacity to cater to the entire demand of an item or 
where it is desirable to have a wider vendor base due to criticality of the 
items, it may become desirable to conclude parallel RCs with more than 
one firm. The CFA, based on the merit of each case, may decide the 
number of firms to be awarded RC for an item so that DDOs will have a 
wider choice. Efforts should be made to conclude parallel RCs with firms 
located in different parts of the country to cater to users over a wider 
geographical spread. Parallel RC may be concluded with marginal price 
difference say up to 5%. In such cases approval of the next higher CFA is 
to be taken.   
   
8.6.2  All DDOs to operate the RCs: Orders against a Rate Contract concluded 
by any authority may be placed on the same terms and conditions by all 
Direct 
Demanding 
Officers 
of 
Services/ 
Departments/ 
Organizations/Units/Establishments under the Ministry of Defence, subject 
to there being no downward trend in prices.   To facilitate such operation, 
a suitable provision should be made in the RCs and the details of the RCs 
posted on the website of the Service/Organization concerned. 
 
 Special Conditions Applicable for Rate Contract 
8.7.1  Special Conditions: Some conditions of rate contract differ from the usual 
conditions applicable for other contracts. Some such important special 
conditions of rate contract are as follows: 
 
 i) Earnest Money Deposit (EMD) is not applicable. 
ii) In the Schedule of Requirement, no quantity is mentioned; only the 
 anticipated drawal may be mentioned without any commitment. 
iii) The purchaser reserves the right to conclude more than one rate 
 contract for the same item. 
iv) The purchaser as well as the supplier may withdraw the rate contract 
by serving suitable notice to each other. The prescribed notice period is 
 generally thirty days. 
v) The purchaser has the option to renegotiate the price with the rate 
contract holders. 
vi) In case of emergency, the purchaser may purchase the same item 
through ad hoc contract with a new supplier. 
  
83 
 
vii) Usually, the terms of delivery in rate contracts are FOR dispatching 
station. This is so, because the rate contracts are to take care of the users 
spread all over the country. However, wherever it is decided to enter into 
RCs which are FOR destination, the cost of transportation should be 
 separately asked for. 
viii) Supply orders, incorporating definite quantity of goods to be supplied 
along with all other required conditions following the rate contract terms, 
 are to be issued for obtaining supplies through the rate contract. 
ix) The purchaser and the authorized users of the rate contract are entitled 
to place supply orders upto the last day of the validity of the rate contract 
and, though supplies against such supply orders will be effected beyond 
the validity period of the rate contract, all such supplies will be guided by 
 the terms and conditions of the rate contract. 
x) The rate contract will be guided by “Fall Clause”. 
 
8.7.2  Fall Clause: Fall clause is a price safety mechanism in rate contracts. The 
fall clause provides that if the rate contract holder reduces its price or sells 
or even offers to sell the rate contracted goods following conditions of sale 
similar to those of the rate contract, at a price lower than the rate contract 
price, to any person or organization during the currency of the rate 
contract, the rate contract price will be automatically reduced with effect 
from that date for all the subsequent supplies under the rate contract and 
the rate contract amended accordingly. Other parallel rate contract 
holders, if any, are also to be given opportunity to reduce their price as 
well, by notifying the reduced price to them and giving them 15 (fifteen) 
days’ time to intimate their revised prices, if they so desire, in sealed cover 
to be opened in public on the specified date and time and further action 
taken as per standard practice. On many occasions, the parallel rate 
contract holders attempt to grab more orders by unethical means by 
announcing reduction of their price (after getting the rate contract) under 
the guise of Fall Clause. This situation is also to be dealt with in similar 
manner as mentioned earlier in this paragraph. It is, however, very 
necessary that the purchase organizations keep special watch on the 
performance of such rate contract holders who reduce their prices on one 
pretext or other. If their performances are not upto the mark, appropriately 
severe action should be taken against them including deregistering them, 
  suspending business deals with them, terminating the contract, etc. 
8.7.3 Performance Security: Depending on the anticipated overall drawal 
against a rate contract and, also, anticipated number of parallel rate 
contracts to be issued for an item, the authority concluding the Rate 
Contract(s) may consider obtaining performance security of reasonable 
  
84 
amount from the Rate Contract holders. A suitable clause to this effect is 
to be incorporated in the tender enquiry documents. Performance Security 
shall, however, not be demanded in the supply orders issued against rate 
contracts.  
  
 8.8 Renewal, Extension, Termination and Revocation of Contracts 
8.8.1  Renewal and Extension: It should be ensured that new rate contracts are 
made operative right after the expiry of the existing rate contracts without 
any gap for all rate contracted items. In case, however, it is not possible to 
conclude new rate contracts due to some special reasons, timely steps 
are to be taken to extend the existing rate contracts with same terms, 
conditions etc. for a suitable period, with the consent of the rate contract 
holders. Rate contracts of the firms, which do not agree to such extension, 
are to be left out of consideration for renewal and extension. Period of 
such extension should generally not be more than three months. Also, 
while extending the existing rate contracts, it shall be ensured that the 
price trend is not lower. 
  
8.8.2  Termination and Revocation of RC:  RC is in the nature of standing offer 
and a legal contract comes into being only when a supply order is placed 
by the CFA/Direct Demanding Officers. Being just a standing offer, 
embodying various terms of the offer, the contract holder may revoke it at 
any time during its currency.  However, reasonable opportunity should be 
given to the supplier to represent against any revocation/cancellation of 
RC.      
  
 8.9 Payment 
8.9.1  Payment Terms:  Standard Payment terms, as indicated below, should 
be incorporated in all Rate Contracts:- 
 
(a) Upto 95 % on receipt of stores at consignee’s premises against 
dispatch document, provisional receipt and copy number 1 of 
Inspection Note. However, in case it becomes essential to dispatch 
stores by train, 90% payment can be released against proof of 
dispatch, i.e., copy of the RR and inspection note. 
 
(b)  Balance on accounting of stores by the consignee. 
 
(c) Payment should be effected by the paying authority within 21 
working days from the date of receipt of bill, if the supporting 
documents meet paying authority requirement. Consolidated 
observations, if any should be forwarded within 10 working days by 
paying authority to the CFA. 
 
  
85 
8.9.2  Paying authority: The organization of the Principal Controller/ Controller 
of Defence Accounts concerned or an authority holding cash 
assignment/imprest and duly authorized to make payment for such 
 procurements will be the paying authority.    
 8.10 Format of the Supply Order 
8.10.1 Format of the Supply Order: The format of the Supply Order on which 
the orders against Rate Contract could be placed by the Direct 
Demanding Officers is given in Appendix ‘F’. For DGS&D RC cases, 
FORM-131 of  DGS&D may be used with suitable changes.

CHAPTER 9 
 
PROCUREMENT OF GOODS AND SERVICES FROM FOREIGN 
COUNTRIES 
 
 9.1 Introduction 
9.1.1.  Import of spares and equipment from the revenue budget constitutes a 
sizeable portion of the overall defence expenditure. The Defence Services 
have been acquiring latest state-of-the-art equipment and weapon 
systems from various foreign countries. To ensure their serviceability at all 
times, it is essential that the spares and equipment support is provided at 
the right time, ensuring value for money spent. Hence, it is of paramount 
importance to lay down comprehensive procedures and policies in respect 
of foreign procurement in line with international procurement practices for 
implementation by all concerned with the process. While proposals for 
procurement of goods and services are also to be processed generally as 
per the procedure laid down in Chapter 5 of the Manual, some special 
features of procurements from abroad are explained in this Chapter. 
 
 9.2 Indents 
9.2.1  Information to be given in the Indents: The process of procurement of 
stores commences only on receipt of indents, duly approved and 
authenticated by the competent authority. Every indent should contain the 
following information:- 
 
(a) Complete details like part numbers and specifications of the equipment 
indented. 
 
(b) A realistic estimate of the cost with basis of assessment so that back 
references to the indenters is avoided. 
 
(c) Where a demand is being indented for the first time, an indication to 
this effect. 
 
(d) When an item has been purchased before, the indent should indicate 
the price at which it was purchased and also give the contract /SO 
number and date and the source of supply. 
 
(e)   Names of likely sources of supply, if available. 
(f)   Reference to the page No. of publication where the item is   described. 
(g) Code Head to which the expenditure is debitable. 
(h) Consignee depot. 
  
87 
(i)  Desired Delivery Schedule. 
(j) Normally, items of similar or allied nature should be indented in one 
indent. 
 
9.2.2  Documents etc. to be furnished along with the Indents: Every Indent 
should 
be 
accompanied 
by 
the 
following 
in 
the 
form 
of 
documents/records/inputs or endorsement in the case of automated 
inventory management system: 
 
(a)    Schedule of Requirement of the indent 
(b)    Complete Technical specifications of the items 
(c) 
A certificate of provision of funds to meet proposed 
expenditure 
 
(d)    A copy of the financial concurrence to the indent 
(e)    A copy of CFA’s approval of the indent 
(f)   A certificate of necessary import clearance, wherever 
applicable 
 
(g)   Proprietary Article Certificate (PAC) given in the prescribed 
format, where applicable   
 
(h)    Priority of the indent, i.e. whether normal or urgent.  
 
 9.3 Registration of Foreign OEMs and Vendors 
9.3.1  Procedure for Registration: At present foreign OEMs and vendors are 
being registered by the Service Headquarters and Headquarters of other 
Departments. Till such time as common guidelines are formulated, these 
Registering Authorities would continue to register foreign OEMs and 
vendors as per the existing procedure followed by them. 
  
9.3.2  Registration of Authorized Vendors/Stockists of Foreign OEMs by the 
Service Headquarters etc.: Widening of the foreign vendor base is a 
multi-disciplinary and techno-commercial exercise. Registration of foreign 
OEMs and their authorized vendors/stockists is to be undertaken as per 
laid down guidelines, with the help of the Defence Attachés and 
Commercial Counselors in the Indian Embassies/High Commissions 
abroad. 
 
 9.4 Vendor Selection 
9.4.1 Prospective vendor(s) to be indicated in the Indent:  Details of 
registered vendors and likely sources of supply are to be indicated in the 
  
88 
indent. Vendors already registered with Army, Navy, Air Force, Ordnance 
factories, DRDO, DGS&D and Defence PSUs for similar items will be 
treated as registered vendors and may be considered for issue of Limited 
Tender Enquiry. The registering agency should include all foreign vendors 
registered with different departments of MOD. However, specific needs of 
the departments/wings are to be kept in mind and complied with. 
  
9.4.2  Selection of vendor: A careful selection of the authorized and registered 
vendors is to be made for the range of spares listed in the Schedule of 
Requirement by the Procuring Agency for the purpose of issuing the RFP. 
Widening of the foreign vendor base is a multi-disciplinary and techno-
commercial exercise. Registration of foreign OEMs and their authorized 
vendors / stockists should be undertaken as per laid down guidelines with 
the help of our Defence Attaché and Commercial Counselors in our 
Embassies / High Commissions abroad. 
  
 9.5 Mode of Tendering 
9.5.1  The mode of tendering should be decided with regard to factors like, 
whether the stores / equipment are general purpose or specialized, likely 
and known sources of supply, expected competition, delivery schedule 
desired, urgency of requirement, etc.. In foreign procurements, one of the 
following methods of inviting tenders can be adopted. 
 
(a) Global tenders Enquiry 
(b) Limited tenders Enquiry  
(c) Single tender Enquiry without Proprietary Article Certificate (PAC) 
 (d) PAC Enquiry 
9.5.2  Global Tender Enquiry:  Global tendering, which is essentially the same 
as Advertised/Open tendering, is to be resorted for items of foreign origin, 
where competition from more than one source from different countries is 
envisaged. Apart from publishing the tenders in newspapers and journals, 
copies of the global tender documents should be sent to respective Indian 
Embassies and High Commissions to seek offers through their liaison. 
The RFP should also be posted on the Defence web site and that of the 
organization so that it could be downloaded by the prospective bidders for 
participating in the tender process. In cases of procurement of highly 
sensitive nature, which has national security implications, the tender 
documents are not to be posted on the web site.  In such cases, specific 
reasons for not putting the RFP on the web site should be recorded while 
seeking CFA’s approval for the procurement proposal.   
 
9.5.3  Limited Tender Enquiry: In all cases of foreign procurement, where the 
indentor has not furnished a PAC, Limited Tender Enquiry (LTE) should 
be the preferred mode of tendering as procurement is to be done from 
OEMs or authorized stockists only. LTE should be sent to as many 
  
89 
registered/known suppliers as possible, but normally the number of firms 
should not be less than six unless the available sources are limited and 
less than six.  
 
9.5.4  Single Tender Enquiry without PAC: Single Tender Enquiry without PAC 
may be adopted in the following circumstances: 
 
(a) Where different makes of any equipment are in use but it is preferred 
to procure only one specific make because of emergency/urgency of 
requirement,  
 
(b) For undertaking trials,  
 
(c) When there is only one known/established source, but the PAC status 
has not been approved by the CFA or 
 
(d) When there are operational or technical reasons for doing so, which 
should, however, be recorded.  
  
9.5.5  Certification by the Indentor: The indentor should certify that only the 
particular make mentioned in the indent should preferably be procured, 
giving detailed justification for the same.   
  
9.5.6  PAC Tendering:  This mode of tendering may be resorted to when the 
items to be procured are proprietary items of a particular firm or for 
reasons of standardization of machinery/spare parts so that these are 
compatible with the existing sets of equipment. STE with PAC for reasons 
of standardization should be resorted to on the advice of the competent 
technical experts. A Proprietary Article Certificate will be accorded by the 
competent authority as per the delegation of powers, establishing the 
monopoly of the product of a single manufacturer.   
 
9.5.7 Single and Two Bid System: The circumstances in which single bid 
system or two bid system should be followed are explained in paragraph 
4.6 of this Manual. 
  
 9.6 (New) Processing of procurement proposals and CFA’s approval 
9.6.1  Processing of proposals: The manner of processing of proposals for 
procurement of goods and services from foreign sources and the 
procedure for obtaining CFA’s approval are the same as mentioned in 
Chapter 5 of this Manual. Special attention, however, needs to be paid to 
preparation of Request for Proposal (RFP) as mentioned in the following 
paragraph. 
  
90 
 9.7 Request for Proposals (RFP) 
9.7.1  RFP format: The RFP is a very important document and should be a true 
and complete reflection of the indent. A standard format of RFP is given in 
Appendix ‘C’. The goods/services required, bidding procedures and 
contract terms are prescribed in the RFP. Special attention should be paid 
to the following aspects while preparing the RFP, keeping in view the 
provisions of paragraphs 9.7.2 to 9.7.29 of this Manual: 
 
(a) 
Description of the required goods and services (Paragraph 9.7.2)

(x) 
Force Majeure (Paragraph 9.7.27) 
(y) 
Claims (Paragraph 9.7.28) 
(z) 
Applicability of Laws (Paragraph 9.7.29) 
9.7.2  Details of Goods and Services: It is of paramount importance that the 
details of the required goods and services are mentioned in the RFP in a 
manner which does not lend itself to varying interpretations by the 
prospective bidders in different countries. The description should be clear 
and precise. 
 
9.7.3  Deadline for Submission of Quotations: Reasonable time should be 
allowed to the vendors to respond to the RFP and submit their bids. 
Normally, six to twelve weeks should be allowed to foreign vendors for 
submission of offers. In case of urgent procurements, this may be reduced 
  to four weeks or even less. 
9.7.4 Period of Validity of Offers: The validity period of the quotations 
mentioned in the RFP should be realistic. The period should be fixed 
keeping in view the nature and quantity of goods and services and the 
time anticipated in completing the post tender formalities. In case of 
foreign procurement, normally a period of ninety to one hundred and 
eighty days may be prescribed, as considered appropriate.  
  
9.7.5  Technical Specifications:  All verifiable technical parameters in terms of 
size, weight, performance, operating environment, power, utility life, 
storage and  shelf life, etc., both in terms of ‘essential’ and ‘desirable’ 
levels, as applicable to the equipment being procured should be listed 
clearly and unambiguously. 
 
9.7.6  Inspection Clauses:  The RFP should clearly provide for Pre-Dispatch 
Inspection (PDI) and/or Joint Receipt Inspection (JRI), as required.  In the 
case of Pre-Dispatch Inspection, to the extent possible, the RFP should 
mention the broad scope of such inspection, the likely number of such 
inspections, the composition of the team and duration of inspections. 
 
9.7.7 Special Conditions:  Any special conditions of contract which are 
applicable to the specific procurement or essential to the performance of a 
particular contract for justifiable reasons and/or are likely to have a 
financial bearing on the vendors’ bids should be mentioned clearly in the 
RFP, e.g., any special payment terms, need for lifetime product support, 
etc. 
 
9.7.8 Quality Assurance: The goods supplied under the contract should 
conform to the standards, which should be clearly mentioned as a part of 
the technical specifications in the RFP. The latest authoritative standards, 
  
92 
issued by the concerned institution, applicable in the country of origin, to 
the goods to be procured could also be considered as acceptable 
standards and, if so decided, it should be mentioned in the RFP. In such 
situations, the RFP should also state that the details of such standards 
would be submitted by the prospective bidder while submitting his bid. All 
the items should be supplied and accepted along with OEM certification 
only. The quality assurance requirements should be specified both in 
terms of testing norms and methodology.  
 
9.7.9  Source of Supply in Case of Vendors/Stockists:  In case the bidder is 
not the OEM, it would be necessary for the bidder to furnish the 
agreement certificate with the OEM from whom the spares are to be 
sourced by the bidder. However, where OEMs do not exist, minor 
aggregates and spares can be sourced from authorized vendors subject to 
quality certification. 
 
9.7.10 Mode and Terms of Delivery and Transportation: The mode of delivery 
could be either on CIF, CIP or FOB basis but it should be decided before 
floating the RFP and clearly indicated therein.  The mode of transportation 
should also be invariably indicated. 
 
9.7.11  Delivery Schedule: The prescribed delivery schedule should be firm and 
not open-ended. Normally the delivery schedule should be fixed in such a 
manner that it is completed within ninety to one hundred and eighty days 
of the signing of contract, unless the circumstances warrant a longer 
delivery schedule. A staggered delivery schedule may be laid down, if 
necessary. It should be clearly mentioned in the RFP that the delivery 
schedule shall be counted from the date of signing of the contract by both 
the parties and include a reasonable time (which should also be specified) 
for the supplier to affect the supplies and then claim the payment. The 
date of delivery of the goods will be the date of Freight Forwarder’s 
receipt, Master AWB or Bill of Lading as applicable. As per the mode of 
payment, the normal delivery schedule for spares procurement should be 
 indicated in the RFP as follows:  
(a) 
L/C Payments: Six months from the date of signing of contract 
 which will include: 
(i)   Obtaining export license and giving notification of readiness for 
 opening of L/C by seller – 45 days. 
(ii) Obtaining Foreign Exchange Release and opening of L/C 
 through CDA by buyer – 45 days 
(iii)  Validity period of L/C – 90 days. The LC will be opened three 
months prior to the expiry of delivery period only.  
  
93 
 
(b) 
DBT Payments :- Preferably within three months of signing of the 
contract 
 
9.7.12 Mode of payment: The normal mode of payment to foreign vendors is 
through irrevocable Letters of Credit or Direct Bank Transfer (DBT). The 
paying authority is the organization of the Principal Controller/Controller 
concerned.  For contracts below USD 1,00,000.00, it should be specified 
in the RFP that the payment would be made through DBT. The format for 
Letter of Credit is given in Form DPM-12.  
  
 9.7.13 Terms of Payment:  
(a) Where the payment is to be made through Letter of Credit, it should be 
opened within forty five days of receipt of notification of readiness of 
goods for delivery from the foreign vendor. The vendor should normally be 
given forty five days from the date of signing of contract for notifying such 
readiness. The period may be varied, as per requirement, but it should be 
decided while processing the proposal and indicated in the RFP. The 
period for notification of readiness of goods and opening of LC should be 
so fixed that LC is opened three months prior to the expiry of the delivery 
period. The period mentioned in the RFP should not be varied, particularly 
in Global Tender Enquiry and Limited Tender Enquiry cases.  
  
(b) It should also be mentioned in the RFP that the LC would be valid for 
ninety days from the date of its opening, on extendable basis by mutual 
consent of both the buyer and the seller, unless it is a revolving LC. The 
period may also be varied, as per requirement, but it should be decided 
while processing the proposal and indicated in the RFP. All expenses 
related to Letters of Credit outside India should be borne by the foreign 
 vendor. 
(c)  In case of extension of delivery period, both LC and delivery period 
 should be extended and the LC charges borne by the supplier.  
(d) Payment through Direct Bank Transfer (DBT) would be mandatory for 
all payments below USD one hundred thousand and such payments 
should be made within thirty days of receipt of clear payment documents 
or as specified in the contract., 
  
9.7.14  Evaluation parameters: Evaluation parameters should be clearly defined 
in the RFP. Wherever required, a detailed technical evaluation matrix 
should be enclosed with the RFP. [In a two-bid system, separate 
evaluation criteria should be laid down for technical evaluation and 
commercial-cum-price negotiation and only those offers should be 
evaluated which are found to be in compliance with the technical 
evaluation parameters as defined in the RFP. Technical evaluation should 
  
94 
be carried out by a Technical Evaluation Committee and approved by the 
competent authority. TEC procedure will be the same as laid down in 
Chapter 4 of this Manual. 
 
 9.7.15 
Performance 
Bank 
Guarantee 
(PBG): 
Whenever 
considered 
appropriate in foreign procurement cases, especially of high value with 
long gestation period, performance security deposit in the form of bank 
guarantee should be taken from the supplier. The bank guarantee is to be 
issued in the prescribed format by an Indian Public Sector Bank or a 
Private Sector bank authorized to conduct government business or a First 
Class International bank of repute located abroad, acceptable to the 
purchaser within thirty days from the date of the signing of the contract. 
Guidelines on confirmation of Bank Guarantees of Foreign banks by 
Indian banks is given in Form DPM-14.This deposit is meant to 
compensate the purchaser for any loss suffered due to failure of the 
supplier to complete his obligation as per the contract.  The PBG amount 
should preferably be five percent of the value of the contract, if there is a 
Risk Purchase clause in the Contract.  However, where Risk and Expense 
Purchase is unenforceable because of single vendor situation and remote 
possibility of recovering from an alternative source, the PBG should be for 
ten per cent to act as a financial cover in the event of failure of the firm to 
perform/recession. [Provisions of Chapter 12 may also be referred to in 
respect of PBG. 
 
9.7.16 Arbitration: There should be an Arbitration clause in the RFP. The 
 provisions of Chapter 10 may be referred to in this regard. 
9.7.17 Liquidated Damages: Provision should also be made in the RFP for 
payment of Liquidated Damages by the foreign supplier. The provisions of 
Chapter 10 may be referred to in this regard. 
  
9.7.18 Advance Payments: Normally no advance should be offered in the RFP. 
However, if it is decided to provide advance payment, the percentage 
should be mentioned upfront in the RFP. As regards the quantum of 
advance and the bank guarantee to secure it, relevant provisions of 
Chapter 7 of this Manual may be referred to. 
 
9.7.19 Installation, Commissioning and AMC: If the equipment/spare parts are 
required to be installed and/or commissioned, and training imparted 
relevant information in this regard should be provided in the RFP and 
concomitant modifications made in other clauses of the RFP. In case 
Annual/Composite Maintenance Contract is required, the period for which 
such contract is required and the scope of services expected of the vendor 
should be clearly spelt out. 
  
  
95 
9.7.20  Life Time Product Support: If there is a requirement for life time product 
support for spares, maintenance advice, defect investigation and 
information on product upgrade, etc., it should also be mentioned in the 
RFP.  
 
9.7.21 Repeat Order and Option Clauses: As in the case of indigenous 
procurement, in the case of procurement from foreign sources also, 
provision for repeat order and option clauses should not be made as a 
matter of course in the RFP as these have a price implication. Either or 
both these clauses may be provided in the RFP only in exceptional 
circumstances, where the consumption pattern is not predictable with the 
stipulation that while exercising one or both these clauses, the overall 
ceiling of fifty percent of the originally contracted quantity will not be 
exceeded. The provisions of paragraph 7.13 of this Manual will be 
applicable in the case of foreign procurements also. 
  
9.7.22 Conditions Governing Repeat Order: Repeat order against a previous 
order may be considered for approval by the CFA subject to the following 
conditions: 
 
(a) Items ordered against the previous order had been delivered 
 successfully. 
(b)  Original order had not been placed to cover urgent/ emergent 
 demand. 
(c) There is no downward trend in the price of the item. A clear certificate 
 should be recorded to that effect. 
(d) The requirement is for stores of identical nature/specifications, 
nomenclature etc. Minor improvements in spec(s) or phasing out of 
products due to obsolescence may not be precluded from the purview of 
 repeat order.  
(e) The repeat order is placed within six months from the date of 
 completion of the supply against the original order.  
(f) The repeat order quantity is restricted to a maximum of fifty percent of 
last order quantity, where the contract does not also include the option 
clause. In case of small orders (quantity 1-7) the repeat order quantity 
 may be rounded off to the next whole number. 
(g) The original order was placed on the basis of lowest price negotiated 
and accepted by the CNC, and was not on delivery or any other 
 preference.  
  
96 
(h) This provision could be exercised in case of PAC/Single vendor OEM 
also.  However, care should be taken before exercising this provision in 
 multi-vendor situation.  
(j) Where the contract also includes option clause, repeat order may be 
placed only for such quantity, which along with the quantity for which 
option clause may have already been exercised, does not result in the 
total quantity under option clause and the repeat order exceeding fifty 
 percent of the originally ordered quantity.   
(k) The CFA will be decided taking into consideration the value of the 
original order quantity and the option cause/repeat order quantity.    
 
9.7.23 Conditions Governing Option Clause: Against an outstanding indent for 
which acceptance of necessity has been approved by CFA, it may be 
advantageous to the purchaser to have an option clause in the main 
contract if agreed to by the supplier that will allow exercising of option 
clause up to fifty per cent of original contracted quantity in accordance 
with the terms and conditions of contract.  This option clause may be 
exercised on approval of the CFA, within whose powers total value of 
original supplies plus value of option clause falls, in consultation with IFA 
where applicable, during currency of the contract. It should be ensured 
that there is no downward trend in the market prices. No fruitful result will 
accrue by floating fresh RFP when items are urgently required.  This 
clause may be exercised in single vendor OEM cases also.  However, 
where multiple vendors are available, necessary care should be taken in 
exercising the option clause. If the contract also contains the repeat order 
clause, it may be kept in mind while placing order under the option clause 
that the total quantity under the option clause and the repeat order cannot 
exceed fifty percent of the originally ordered quantity.  
  
9.7.24 Risk & Expense Clause:  In case of foreign contracts, risk and expense 
clause is generally not applicable, though there could be some exceptions. 
If, in exceptional circumstances, it is decided to include this clause in the 
RFP, provisions of paragraph 7.14 of this Manual may be kept in view. In 
the absence of this clause, other remedies available to the purchaser are 
as follows:  
 
(a) 
Deduct the quantitative cost of discrepancy from any of the 
outstanding payments of the supplier. 
 
(b) 
Avoid issue of further RFP to the firm till resolution of the 
discrepancy. 
 
(c) 
Bring up the issue of discrepancy in all meetings with the 
representative of supplier. 
  
97 
 
(d) 
Provide for adequate Performance Bank Guarantee to cover such 
risks. 
 
(e) 
Approach the Government of the supplier’s country through the 
Ministry of Defence if needed. 
 
(g) 
Consider deregistering the firm from the approved list of firms, if 
necessary. 
  
9.7.25 Apportionment of Quantity: Provisions of paragraph 7.15 of this Manual 
  will be applicable in the case of foreign procurement also. 
9.7.26 Acceptance of Excess or Short Deliveries:  Provisions of paragraph 
7.16 of this Manual will apply in this regard.   
 
9.7.27 Force Majeure: As mentioned in paragraph 7.12 of this Manual, wherever 
considered necessary, this clause may be included in the RFP and the 
contract relating to foreign procurements also as per the format given in 
Part-IV of Appendix C. 
 
9.7.28 Claims: It should be clearly mentioned in the RFP that the purchaser shall 
promptly notify the supplier in writing of any claims arising under the 
warranty.  The time period generally acceptable for notifying the claim, 
which may be indicated in the RFP, is as follows:  
  
(a) For quantitative discrepancy - Within ninety days from the date of 
delivery of the consignment in case of delivery by Air or road and within 
one hundred and twenty days from date of delivery in case of delivery by 
 Sea. 
(b) For qualitative discrepancy - The warranty should remain valid for 
twelve months after the goods or any portion thereof, as the case may be, 
have been delivered to and accepted at the final destination indicated in 
the contract, or for eighteen months after the date of shipment from the 
  place of loading, whichever period concludes earlier. 
(c) For quality claims on account of defects or deficiencies: The 
quality claims for defects or deficiencies in quality noticed during the JRI 
shall be presented within forty five days of completion of JRI and 
acceptance of goods. Quality claims shall be presented for defects or 
deficiencies in quality noticed during warranty period earliest but not later 
than forty five days after expiry of the guarantee period. The quantity and 
quality claims should be submitted to the seller in the prescribed format 
given in Forms DPM-22 and DPM-23 respectively. 
 
  
98 
9.7.29 Applicability of Law: It should be mentioned clearly in the RFP that the 
contract will be made, interpreted and governed in accordance with the 
laws of the Republic of India. 
 
 9.8 Processing of Proposal after CFA’s approval 
9.8.1  Issue of Request for Proposal (RFP): The decision regarding mode of 
tendering to be adopted in a particular case is required to be taken while 
seeking CFA’s approval. The guidelines given in Chapter 4 of this Manual 
regarding publicity and dispatch of RFPs should be followed in foreign 
procurement cases also. As per those guidelines, the RFPs to foreign 
vendors can be sent by registered post. In addition, these may be sent by 
fax or e-mail also, which should, however, be followed by a copy by 
registered post. RFPs will not be given to Indian agents of foreign firms.  
However, if any foreign firm has its branch office in India, RFPs can be 
given to it. Meticulous records of mode of issue/dispatch of RFPs should 
be maintained.   
  
9.8.2  Extension of Tender Opening Date, Clarification/ Amendment of 
Tender Documents and Modification/Withdrawal of Bids: The relevant 
provisions of Chapter 4 should be followed in this regard. 
  
9.8.3   Resultant Single Vendor Situation – Provisions contained in para 4.15 
of Chapter 4 will be applicable in the case of foreign procurements also. 
 
9.8.4 Comparative Statement of Tenders - On receipt of all accepted tenders, 
the purchase cell should collate them in the form of a Comparative 
Statement of Tenders (CST). The CST should be exhaustive and must 
include all details given in the quotations. Deviation from the tender 
documents is to be brought out in the CST. Last Purchase Price (LPP), 
wherever available, should be indicated for a fair comparison of the 
offered prices. CST should be vetted by the IFA with reference to original 
quotations, indents and other supporting documents, where financial 
powers are to be exercised with the concurrence of integrated finance. 
The purchase officer should sign the CST. 
 
9.8.5 Exchange Rate: Exchange Rate applicable for various currencies 
prevailing on the date of opening of commercial bid as indicated in the 
RFP for two bid cases and date of bid opening for single bids will be taken 
into account for working out the prices in Rupee Terms for comparison. 
        
  
99 
  9.9 Commercial Negotiations and Conclusion of Contract/Supply Order 
9.9.1 Commercial Negotiations: The procedure laid down in Chapter 5 of this 
Manual for constitution of the CNC, commercial negotiations, determining 
price reasonableness and recording of minutes of CNC would be followed 
for foreign procurement also. 
  
9.9.2  Obtaining best offer through Fax: In case of foreign firms, which do not 
have their regional offices in India, it may not be possible for their 
representatives to come for CNC meetings except for high value items. In 
such cases, CNC/CFA may obtain the best revised offer with all terms 
clarified from the lowest bidder through fax before finalizing the price. 
 
9.9.3 Action by the CNC: CNC recommendation is to be clear and 
unambiguous. A counter offer may be made to the L1 firm only by the 
CNC. In case the CNC/CFA is unable to conclude the negotiations 
satisfactorily, it may refer the case to the next higher CFA for conducting 
negotiations. The minutes of all CNC meetings should be meticulously 
maintained and signed by all members.  
  
9.9.4 Acceptance of Cost Over Estimates: When it is proposed to accept an 
offer higher than the sanctioned indent price which may be based on last 
purchase price or assessed price, the empowered CFA may accept such 
an offer within delegated powers provided the increased amount is within 
his delegated powers and after recording reasons for doing so. Whenever 
the increased amount exceeds the financial powers of the CFA, approval 
of next higher CFA, within whose delegated powers the case falls, should 
be taken.   
 
9.9.5  Acceptance of an offer other than L1:  In no case,  an offer other than 
the lowest would be accepted. 
   
9.9.6  Determination of L1 on Entire Package: In case an RFP contains a large 
number of items of spares and it is indicated in the RFP that L1 will be 
decided based on the package price, the  L1 offer should be determined on 
the basis of the cash outflow for the entire package.  After determining L1 
in this manner, negotiations should be held with that firm in respect of 
items for which rates quoted by the firm are higher than those quoted by 
other vendors.  In such cases, negotiation with L1 vendor would have to be 
done with reference to the lowest bid for that item (items).  In case the L1 
vendor does not reduce his price reasonably for high value item(s), 
possibility of concluding a fresh contract by issuing a separate RFP for 
such item(s) may be considered keeping in view the operational 
requirements.  
   
  
100
9.9.7  Purchase Decision: The CFA/Committee CFA must consider all aspects 
of the case including reasonability of offered prices, quoted terms and 
conditions, technical evaluation report etc. It has to be ensured that proper 
policies and procedure have been followed at various stages of 
procurement for determining L1 firm.  The financial implication should be 
considered as the all-inclusive cost to the user on delivery to the 
designated consignee. Purchase decisions should be taken through a 
formal written order. 
   
9.9.8  Signing of the Contract/Placement of Supply Order:  The draft contract, 
duly vetted by the IFA, where required as per delegation of financial 
powers, should be put up for CFA’s approval before concluding the 
contract with the vendor. The contract/supply order should be signed by 
an officer authorized to do so.  The contract /supply order should be 
signed on each page by the authorized representative of the vendor and 
duly acknowledged as accepted. 
 
9.9.9  Amendment to Contract:  All amendments to contracts, which have 
financial implications, including short closing and delivery period 
extensions with or without imposition of liquidated damages, should be 
invariably approved by the CFA, and also in consultation with the IFA, 
wherever the original contract was concluded with the concurrence of 
integrated finance.  Amendments affecting delivery period should not be 
made as a matter of routine.  All cases for extension of delivery period 
should be processed with imposition of liquidated damages and other 
penalties as per the contract, except for the cases where the contract 
provides for waiving off of the liquidated damages on account of justified 
reasons.   
  
9.9.10 Re-tendering: Re-tendering may be recommended by the CNC with 
caution and approved by the CFA with the concurrence of the IFA, 
wherever applicable, under the circumstances mentioned in paragraph 
4.16.1 of this Manual. 
 
9.9.11 Standard Conditions of Contract - Foreign Procurement: The 
Standard conditions of contract will apply to all contracts made/supply 
orders placed as per the procedure laid down in this Manual, except to the 
extent that any clause thereof has been modified in any particular 
contract/supply order. The details of the standard conditions of contract 
are covered in Chapter 10. The specimen format of the RFP given in 
Appendix ‘C’ includes these standard conditions of contract. A few aspects 
of these standard conditions, which require special attention, are 
explained in paragraph 9.7 of this Chapter for better understanding. 
   
  
101
 
 9.10 PAC Tendering 
9.10.1 Where OEMs are not permitted to deal directly: If the legislation of a 
foreign country does not permit the OEMs and/or other vendors/suppliers 
to respond directly to the RFPs, as in the case of Russia, RFPs may be 
issued to the government designated agency (e.g. Rosoboronexport in the 
case of Russia) on Single Tender Enquiry basis. RFPs to such agencies 
may be issued in addition to the vendors who are permitted to respond 
directly to tender enquiries. 
  
9.10.2 Procurements 
governed 
by 
General 
Contracts: 
In 
case 
of 
procurements 
under 
long 
term 
General/Umbrella 
contracts/Main 
agreements between the Government of India and the Government of the 
country concerned, provisions of the such contracts/agreements will 
prevail in respect of the format of the RFP,  quotations, general terms and 
conditions, time of submission of quotations, LD Clause,  etc. However, 
provisions of this Manual shall apply in respect of those aspects that are 
not covered by such contracts/agreements. 
 
[Note: 
The 
authorities 
concerned 
should 
review 
such 
existing 
contracts/agreements and consider the possibility of amending them to 
bring them in conformity with the provisions of this Manual to the extent 
feasible.]  
 
9.10.3 Urgent 
procurement 
through 
Indian 
Embassies 
abroad: 
Spares/components that are required urgently from sources abroad may 
be procured through the Indian Embassies. On acceptance of necessity, 
an urgent indent should be forwarded to the concerned embassy for 
procurement under the financial powers of the concerned Commercial or 
Defence Attaché (DA). The concerned attaché should register the indent 
and obtain quotes. He should obtain the expenditure angle sanction in 
consultation with the Councellor (Coord) or any other officer with technical/ 
procurement/financial background designated by the Ambassador/High 
Commissioner for this purpose. In case the quotes received are higher 
than the delegated financial powers of the DA and the vendor does not 
agree to reduce the cost, the case should be referred to the concerned 
Service Headquarter/Department of the Ministry of Defence for seeking 
expenditure angle approval of the appropriate CFA. 
 
 9.11 INCO Terms 
9.11.1 INCO TERMS: Since 1936 INCO terms are used in International 
Documentary Credits in respect of mode/style of delivery of goods, which 
have been recognized as practical, cost saving tools, used worldwide for 
smooth international trading practice. The RFP should indicate the 
  
102
applicable INCO terms for delivery of goods and incorporate them in the 
contract to avoid disputes at a later date. The INCO terms are described in 
Form DPM-6.

STANDARD CONDITIONS OF CONTRACT  
- FOREIGN PROCUREMENT 
 
 10.1 Introduction 
10.1.1 Standard Conditions of Contract (SCoC): In order to facilitate a clear 
understanding of the conditions of contract, a set of standard conditions, 
generally applicable to all contracts, is formulated and made available to 
all firms dealing with the department. The Standard Conditions of Contract 
(SCoC) are made available to the firm at the time of registration itself. It is 
desirable that the SCoC are publicized on the Defence web site also. The 
clauses pertaining to SCoC are given in Part-III of Appendix C. The 
Tender Enquiry should invariably make a reference to the applicability of 
SCoC and bidders are expected to conform to the SCoC. The contract 
must stipulate that the SCoC are applicable in addition to any special 
conditions specific to the contract, which might have been mutually agreed 
to between the parties. The terms and conditions that need special 
attention have been explained in Chapter 9 of this Manual. The provisions 
of this Chapter are supplementary to the provisions of Chapter 9 of this 
Manual.

as mentioned in the RFP and the recommendations of the CNC, if held, as 
accepted by the CFA. 
  
10.1.3 Commencement and validity of the contract: A contract commences 
from the ‘effective date’ of the contract, which normally is the date on 
which the contract is signed, unless specified otherwise in the contract. A 
contract is valid from the date of its signing or as specified in the contract, 
till the fulfillment of all obligations under the contract by both the parties.

CHAPTER 11 
 
 REPAIR CONTRACTS WITH FOREIGN AND INDIGENOUS FIRMS 
 11.1 Introduction 
11.1.1 Peculiarity of Repair Contracts With Foreign/Indigenous Firms: The 
contracts for repair of equipment by foreign/indigenous firms are generally 
formulated and processed in the same manner as the contracts for 
procurement of stores from foreign/indigenous sources. However, in some 
respects, repair contracts are different from procurement contracts as they 
have some unique features related to their processing, as also the terms 
and conditions of contracts, as set out in this chapter.  
 
11.1.2 Applicability of this Chapter to Repair Contracts With Indian Firms: 
The provisions of this chapter would also apply to repair contracts with 
indigenous firms. 
 
11.1.3 Terms used in this Chapter: The term “Customer” used in this Chapter 
shall mean the President of India acting through the officer signing the 
contract and the term “Contractor” would mean the firm undertaking the 
repair as per the contract. 
 
 11.2 Unique features related to processing of repair contracts  
11.2.1 Preparation of Indents: The repair indent, to be sent by the Indentor to 
the Procuring Agency, should clearly specify the type of equipment, 
Quantity, type of repairs, history of previous major repair, name of the 
manufacturer, Total Technical Life (TTL), assessed cost of the repair, etc,.  
The amount should preferably be assessed or, if such assessment is not 
feasible, obtained through a non-obligatory budgetary quote from all the 
possible sources, including the OEM. 
 
11.2.2 Selection of Vender: The repair should be carried out by the original 
equipment manufacturer only.  In case the original equipment 
manufacturer expresses inability to undertake the repairs, any agency 
authorized by the OEM may be approached. In the event of the OEM 
expressing difficulty to undertake repairs and there being no OEM 
authorized agency to undertake repairs, other possible sources may be 
approached. The contractor has to be made accountable for the 
performance of the equipments.  There should be suitable PBG and 
Warranty Guarantee provisions in the contract. In the case of Local Repair 
Contracts the repairs may be got done directly through trade, if considered 
feasible, within the delegated powers of the CFAs.

CHAPTER 12 
BANKING INSTRUMENTS 
 
12.1 General 
 
12.1.1 Import Regulation: Import is regulated by the Directorate General of 
Foreign Trade (DGFT) under Ministry of Commerce and Industry, 
Department of Commerce, Government of India. Authorized dealers, while 
undertaking import transactions, should ensure that the imports into India 
are in conformity with the Foreign Trade Policy in force (as decided and 
framed by DGFT) and Foreign Exchange Management (Current Account 
Transactions) Rules, 2000 framed by Government of India vide Notification 
No G.S.R. 381(E) dated 03 May 2000 and the directions issued by Reserve 
Bank of India under Foreign Exchange Management Act from time to time. 
 
12.1.2 Uniform Customs and Practices for Documentary Credits: Importer 
should follow normal banking procedures and adhere to the provisions of 
Uniform Customs and Practices for Documentary Credits (UCPDC) while 
opening Letters of Credit for import into India. 
 
12.2 Letter Of Credit (LC) and the reasons for using them 
12.2.1  A letter of credit is a written understanding given by the buyer’s bank (the 
issuing bank) on behalf of and at the request of its customer (the 
applicant) routed through the agency of a bank in the seller’s country 
(advising bank) to the seller that it (issuing bank) guarantees to pay the 
seller for the goods within a specified time provided that the conditions laid 
down in documentary credit are fully satisfied.  While an LC can be 
established in any of the 27 Public Sector banks besides SBI, it has been 
decided after careful consideration that for the present LCs may be 
opened only through the State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda and Canara 
Bank. The format for LC is given in Form DPM-12.   
 
12.2.2 Reasons for using LC: In international trade, buyer and seller being 
located in different countries may not know each other well. The two 
countries would have different legal systems, currencies and trade and 
exchange regulations.  Due to this fact, both the Buyer and the Seller, need 
some conditions to be fulfilled, to suit their requirements, before releasing 
the payments and goods respectively. The buyer and seller want the 
 following:  
(a) 
A Seller would want: 
 
(i) To be paid as soon as he ships the goods. 
  
118
(ii) 
An assurance that he will be paid by the buyer or his bank as per 
contractual obligations. 
(iii) Convenience of receiving payments in his own country. 
 
(b) 
A Buyer would want: 
 
(i) To pay for the goods only after they are shipped by the seller. 
(ii) 
An assurance that the seller will ship the goods ordered for and 
deliver them in time. 
 
 12.3 Forms of Letter of Credit 
12.3.1 Basic forms of Letters of Credit (LsC) - Basic forms of LCs as 
applicable to Defence Departments are as follows: 
 
(a) 
Revocable letter of credit. 
(b) 
Irrevocable letter of credit. 
(c) 
Confirmed letter of credit. 
(d) 
Revolving letter of credit 
 
12.3.2 Revocable Letter Of Credit: A revocable letter of credit is one which may 
be amended or cancelled by the issuing bank at any moment without prior 
notice to the beneficiary.  Therefore, such a type of letter of credit does not 
give complete sense of security to the beneficiary. However, the notice of 
amendment or cancellation is effective only upon receipt of such notice by 
the advising bank.  If the advising bank has undertaken liability (i.e. paid, 
negotiated or accepted) against documents, which appear on the face of it 
to be in conformity with the terms and conditions of the credit, before 
receiving notice of amendment/cancellation, the issuing Bank is bound to 
reimburse the advising bank.  If the letter of credit is silent as to whether it 
is revocable or irrevocable, the credit is deemed to be irrevocable. 
 
12.3.3 Irrevocable Letter Of Credit: When the issuing Bank gives a definite, 
absolute and irrevocable undertaking to honour its obligations, provided 
the beneficiary complies with all the terms and conditions, such a credit is 
known as an irrevocable letter of credit. It means that the letter of credit 
cannot be amended, cancelled or revoked without the consent of the 
parties to the letter of credit. This gives the beneficiary a definite 
protection. 
 
12.3.4 Confirmed Letter Of Credit: A confirmed letter of credit is one in respect 
of which another Bank in the beneficiary’s country adds its confirmation at 
the request of the issuing Bank.  This undertaking of the confirming Bank 
to pay/ negotiate/accept is in addition to the undertaking of the issuing 
bank.  This is an added protection to the beneficiary. This is not to be 
agreed to as it undermines the credibility of our Nationalized Banks. 
 
  
119
12.3.5 Revolving Letter Of Credit: In such Letters of Credits, the amount is 
restored, after it has been utilized, to the original amount. Such credits are 
used when the buyer is to receive partial shipment of goods at specific 
intervals over a long duration.  It can be cumulative or non-cumulative in 
nature.  It avoids opening letter of credit for each and every consignment. 
 
12.3.6 Divisible and non-divisible LCs: The above mentioned Letters of Credit 
could be divisible or non-divisible.  Divisible Letters of Credit could be 
opened when more than one beneficiary is allowed and payment has to be 
made as per the consignment.   
 
12.4 Procedure for Opening Letters of Credit and Working of the LC 
 Mechanism 
12.4.1 Opening of Letters of Credit: The procedure for opening of an LC would 
generally include steps as given below: -  
 
(a) Step-1: Receipt of PBG and intimation from the Supplier regarding 
readiness of goods for dispatch by the contract concluding authority as per 
contractual terms from the supplier. 
 
(b) Step-2: The contract concluding authority seeks FFE release from the 
 appropriate authority.   
(c) Step-3:  On release of FFE the contract concluding authority forwards 
the case for opening of LC to the Principal Controller/Controller of Defence 
Accounts concerned, who after proper scrutiny of all details for 
correctness, authorizes the bank to open the LC. The bank establishes the 
LC and intimates the Principal Controller/ Controller of Defence Accounts 
concerned and the contract concluding authority.   
 
12.4.2 Payment Through Letter of Credit: The letter of credit mechanism 
 operates as follows:  
(a) 
The Buyer requests the issuing bank to open an LC. 
 
(b) 
The Issuing Bank conveys LC through the Advising bank. 
 
(c) 
The Advising bank advises the credit to the beneficiary. 
 
(d) 
The Beneficiary, after complying with terms and conditions against 
stipulated documents, gets the value either from the Advising bank 
or the Nominated bank as per the terms of the LC. 
(e) 
After passing on the value, the negotiating advising Bank claims 
reimbursement from the issuing Bank or nominated bank as per the 
terms of LC.  
 
  
120
(f) 
Ultimately, the issuing Bank recovers the amount from the 
applicant. It is the definite commitment of the issuing Bank to 
reimburse to the negotiating advising bank whether applicant 
provides the value of negotiation or not. 
 
12.5 Essential Elements of LC 
 
12.5.1 The format of the Letter of Credit is given in Form DPM-12. Following

required to be provided to the advising Bank by the Supplier as proof of 
dispatch of goods as per contractual terms to get his payment against the 
Letter of credit.  The advising Bank forwards one set each of these

Buyer’s and Seller’s QA Deptt.  
(i)      Phyto-sanitary/Fumigation Certificate, if applicable 
(j) 
Performance Bond/Warranty Certificate 
(k) 
Authenticated signature of the supplier or his authorized 
representative should be available with the bank and verified by 
them before releasing LC payment.  
 
12.7 Extension of LC 
12.7.1 Points to be Checked: The following points should be checked by the 
Contract concluding authority before initiating the case for extension of 
LC:   
 
(a) 
Extension of delivery date in the contract and corresponding 
amendment in LC for latest date of shipment. 
 
 
(b) 
Performance Bank Guarantee (PBG) extension. 
 
(c) 
Onus of charges for LC extension. 
 
12.7.2 Approvals Required:  An LC may be extended only with the prior 
concurrence of the IFA, where the LC was originally opened with the 
 concurrence of integrated finance, and approval of the CFA. 
12.8  Direct Bank Transfer 
 
12.8.1 Direct Bank Transfer (DBT):  A transferable credit is a credit under which 
the Beneficiary may request the bank authorized to pay, incur a deferred 
payment undertaking, accept or negotiate or in the case of a freely 
negotiable credit, the bank specifically authorized in the credit as a 
transferring bank to make the credit available in whole or in part to one or 
 more than one beneficiaries. Direct Bank Transfer shows high degree of 
  
122
trust between parties. Buyer ensures that the payment is released only 
after receipt of the documents listed in paragraph 12.6.1 and confirmation 
from the Supplier that one set of the documents has been sent to the port 
consignee immediately after dispatch of the stores. 
 
12.8.2 Advice to the Principal Controller/Controller: After obtaining the above 
mentioned documents, the details of which should form part of the 
contract, the contract concluding authority advises the Principal Controller/ 
Controller of Defence Accounts concerned to effect Direct Bank Transfer. 
The Principal Controller/Controller concerned, in turn, authorizes the 
Buyer’s bank to make direct transfer of funds to the Seller’s bank account. 
 
12.8.3 Advantages of DBT: In comparison with payments through Letters of 
Credit, payment through DBT has the following advantages:  
 
(a) 
Payment is released only after receipt of goods. 
 
(b) 
Payment is made only after full satisfaction to the quality, quantity 
etc. 
 
(c) 
It is cost-effective as compared with LCs.   
 
12.8.4 DBT for Contracts below USD 1,00,000: For contracts below USD 
100,000 DBT payment terms should be insisted upon at the time of 
concluding the contract.   
 
12.9  Delivery Schedules 
12.9.1  Delivery of goods: The normal schedule for delivery of goods in case of 
 LC and DBT payment terms should be as follows:  
(a) 
L/C Payments: Six months from the date of signing of the contract 
 which will include: 
(i) Obtaining export license and giving notification of readiness for 
 opening of L/C by the seller – 45 days. 
(ii) Obtaining Foreign Exchange Release and opening of L/C 
 through the Principal Controller/Controller by the buyer – 45 days 
(iii) 
Validity period of L/C – 90 days. The LC will be opened three 
 months prior to the expiry of the delivery period only.  
In case the spares under procurement are in large quantity or their 
technical production cycle is long as specified by the seller in the 
  
123
RFP, the LC shall be opened for more than one quarter as per the 
terms of the contract. 
 
(b) 
DBT Payments: Preferably within three months of the signing of 
the contract 
 
12.10 Performance Bank Guarantee (PBG) 
 
12.10.1  Definition: PBG is a written undertaking obtained from the Supplier 
through his bank as a guarantee that he would perform the promise/terms 
and conditions of the contract and to ensure the discharge of liability of the 
Supplier in case of his default.  The guidelines and format of performance 
 bank guarantee are given in Forms DPM-14 and DPM-15 respectively. 
12.10.2 Essential Elements of PBG: The essential elements of PBG are as 
follows:   
 
(a) 
Amount 
(b) 
Address of the Beneficiary, Applicant and the Bank 
(c) 
Validity date 
(d) 
Contract Number and Date 
  
  12.11 Guarantees 
 12.11.1 The salient features of Guarantees are as follows: 
(a) 
Guarantees are absolute in character and independent of the 
underlying contract. 
 
(b) 
Guarantees imply obligation to pay and not to perform. 
 
(c) 
Guarantees also imply unconditional and without demur payment 
against a valid claim. 
 
(d) 
Guarantees are for specified amount and period 
 
(e) 
Guarantees are issued against matching counter-guarantee from 
the applicant. 
  
12.11.2 Invocation of Guarantees: Guarantees can only be invoked after 
fulfilling the following conditions: 
 
(a) 
The claim/intimation should reach the issuing Bank on or before the 
expiry date 
  
124
 
(b) 
The claim/intimation should be in strict conformity with the terms of 
the Guarantee. 
 
(c) 
Issuing Bank cannot enquire into merits of the claimant or take 
views on any dispute between the applicant and the beneficiary. 
 
(d) 
On compliance of terms of the guarantee, payments are to be 
effected immediately and unconditionally. 
 
Confirmation of various types of Guarantees: 
12.12.1 Confirmation of Guarantees: Confirmation of Performance Bank 
Guarantee/ Advance Bank Guarantee/ Warranty Bond for indigenous and 
foreign vendors should be undertaken as follows: 
 
(a) 
Indigenous Vendors: Bank guarantee issued by any of the Public 
Sector Banks or private banks duly authorized to conduct 
government transactions would be accepted. 
 
(b) 
Foreign Vendors: Advice of the SBI should be taken whether the 
foreign bank providing bank guarantee for advance is a first class 
bank of International repute before taking a decision whether such 
PBG should be further confirmed by any Public Sector Bank or 
private bank duly authorized to conduct government transactions. 
 
* ICICI Bank Ltd., Axis Bank Ltd and HDFC Bank Ltd are at present 
the private sector banks authorized to conduct government 
transactions. IDBI Bank Ltd has been converted into a Public 
Sector Bank.

CHAPTER 13 
 
EVALUATION OF QUOTATIONS AND PRICE REASONABILITY 
 
  13.1 Introduction 
13.1.1 Cost Estimation: Correct estimation of rates/cost is vital for determining 
the CFA and establishing the reasonability of the offers received from the 
suppliers. It is, therefore, important that the rates/cost are worked out in a 
realistic, objective and professional manner on the basis of the prevailing 
market 
rates, 
last 
purchase 
price, 
economic 
indices 
for 
raw 
material/labour, other input costs and assessment based on intrinsic value 
etc. It is equally important to evaluate the quotations/offers received in 
response to the RFP correctly to select the best offer. This Chapter 
contains guidelines for assessment of rates/cost, evaluation of quotations 
and determining price reasonability. 
 
 13.2 Costing of Procurement Proposals 
13.2.1 Need for costing: The first stage at which costing needs to be done is 
when the proposal is initiated by the Procuring Agency. It is necessary to 
work out the complete cost of a procurement proposal to determine 
availability of funds to meet the expected cash outflow and the level at 
which it would need to be approved. It is, therefore, essential that the cost 
is assessed realistically and comprehensively. The entire, all inclusive 
assessed cost should be the basis for determining the CFA. 
 
13.2.2 Basis of costing: The cost of a procurement proposal may be assessed 
on the basis of the Last Purchase Price (LPP), Professional Officers’ 
Valuation (POV), Budgetary Quote (BQ) to be obtained from one or more 
prospective sellers, Market Survey (MS), or any other method as may be 
appropriate in the context of a particular purchase proposal. These 
methods are not mutually exclusive. The method of costing should be 
clearly recorded while seeking CFA’s approval. 
 
13.2.3 Cost to be worked out in INR: Wherever applicable, the assessed cost 
should be converted into the common denomination of Indian Rupees 
(INR) and shown both in terms of the foreign currency and INR while 
seeking CFA’s approval. The exchange rate adopted should be as on the 
date of opening of the price bids. The conversion factor should be clearly 
indicated. The method of conversion is given in this Chapter.  
 
  
126
 13.3 Evaluation of Quote 
13.3.1 Evaluating financial implication of offers: While RFP is issued on the 
basis of the assessed cost, as approved by the CFA, the next important 
stage in the process is the stage at which the bids received in response to 
the RFP are required to be evaluated to work out the total financial 
implication and reasonability of each offer. The first step in arriving at the 
decision regarding reasonability of price or otherwise is to determine the 
exact cost of the proposal. In order to ensure that all offers are compared 
in an equitable and fair manner and the vendors are provided a level 
playing field, all elements of cost, including the terms and conditions with 
financial implications are to be taken into account. The criteria to be 
adopted for this purpose should be indicated in the RFP and the 
quotations should be ranked as per those criteria. In the case of medical 
equipment where five years warranty/guarantee is provided for, firms may 
be asked to quote comprehensive AMC rates for five years on expiry of 
warranty/ guarantee and these may be loaded in CST and taken into 
consideration while deciding the L1 vendor. However, this evaluation 
criterion would be clearly indicated in the RFP in such cases. 
 
13.3.2 Basis of comparison of cost: The basis for comparison of cost in 
different situations would be as follows: 
 
(a) When the competition is only among the Indian Suppliers, the F.O.R 
Prices at destination (Consignee’s premises) should be the basis for 
ranking of quotations.  
 
(b) If the competition is amongst foreign suppliers, the basis for 
comparison should be the landed price at the destination (designated port) 
only. 
 
(c) When the competition is amongst indigenous and foreign suppliers, the 
basic cost (CIF) quoted by the foreign suppliers should be the basis for 
comparison with the basic cost offered by the indigenous suppliers, after 
offloading the Excise Duty (ED), Central Sales Tax/VAT and other local 
taxes and levies. The term ‘indigenous supplier’ would include Defence 
PSUs and the Indian Ordnance Factories (OFs). 
 
13.3.3 Determining CIF cost: When the quotations of foreign vendors are also 
to be compared with the quotation of indigenous suppliers, CIF cost of 
foreign supplier is to be taken into account but difficulty arises when only 
FOB/FCA cost is indicated by a foreign supplier. There cannot be any 
standard formula for arriving at the CIF value in such cases. It would not 
be desirable to add a notional additional cost as a percentage of FOB/FCA 
cost to arrive at the CIF cost. To avoid a situation like this, it should be 
clearly indicated in the RFP that the foreign vendors should indicate the 
CIF cost.  
  
127
 
13.3.4 Comparative Statement of Tenders: On receipt of all accepted tenders, 
the Procuring Agency should collate them in the form of a Comparative 
Statement of Tenders (CST).  The prices quoted in foreign currencies 
should be converted into INR indicated in the CST. The rate of conversion 
of foreign currency into INR prevailing on the date of opening of the price 
bid may be taken into account for converting the quoted price into INR. 
The rate can be obtained from SBI Parliament Street, New Delhi. The CST 
should be exhaustive and it must include all details given in the 
quotations.  Any deviation from the tender documents is to be brought out 
in the CST. LPP, wherever available, should be indicated in the CST for a 
fair comparison of the offered prices. The purchase officer should sign the 
CST and it should be vetted and countersigned by the IFA/IFA’s 
representative with regard to original quotations, indents and other 
supporting documents, where financial powers are to be exercised with 
the concurrence of integrated finance. 
 
13.3.5 Determination of lowest acceptable offer:  What would be done on the 
file is the preparation of comparative statement, checking of calculations, 
the premises on which the comparative statement of tenders has been 
prepared and prima facie determination of L1 offer. However, it would be 
the CNC only which will finally determine the lowest acceptable offer (L1 
vendor).  
 
   
13.3.6  Negotiations and benchmarking: In multi-vendor cases, on opening of 
commercial offers, once L1 vendor is identified, the contract should be 
concluded with him and there would be no need for any further price 
negotiations.  However, negotiations can be held in exceptional 
circumstances where valid logical reasons exist and such negotiations 
should be held only with L1.  The exceptional situations include 
procurement of proprietary items, items with limited sources of supply and 
items where there is suspicion of cartel formation. The justification and 
details of such negotiations should however be duly recorded and 
documented without loss of time and convincing reasons must be 
recorded by the authority recommending the negotiation. Negotiations 
through a CNC/PNC should be conducted in case of single tender 
situations including PAC cases. Negotiations may also have to be 
conducted in multi-vendor cases where the offered price is considered 
high with reference to the assessed reasonable price taking into account 
inter alia, the competition observed from the response of the trade to the 
inquiry. In each case the CNC/PNC should record its recommendations 
regarding the reasonableness of the price offered by the L1 bidder and the 
need for negotiation or otherwise with detailed justification. Based on the 
recommendation of TPC/CNC/PNC, negotiation may be undertaken in 
consultation with the Integrated Finance and approval of the CFA. In 
cases where a decision is taken to go for re-tendering, but the 
  
128
requirements are urgent, negotiations may be under taken with L1 
bidder(s) for the supply of a bare minimum quantity in accordance with 
para 3 of CVC instructions dated 3rd March 2006 (not reproduced in this 
Manual). 
 
 13.3.7 Bench Marking: Before scheduled negotiation, (wherever considered 
necessary), it would be advisable to work out the estimated reasonable 
rate or the benchmark, to judge acceptability of the L1 offer based on 
available information. The approach to be adopted for assessing 
reasonability in different contingencies is given below.   
 
   
 13.4 Reasonableness of Prices in Competitive Tendering 
13.4.1 Determining Reasonability of Prices: In the case of competitive 
tendering where two or more vendors are competing independently to 
secure a contract, the competitive bids form the basis for determining 
reasonableness of prices.  Database maintained on cost, based on 
concluded contracts, price of the product available through market, etc. 
should also be used to assess reasonableness of the price offered. 
 
(a) 
Evaluation of tenders is to be made on the basis of the ultimate 
  cost to the user. 
(b) 
As a general principle, no offer involving any uncertain or indefinite 
  liability or any condition of unusual character should be considered. 
(c) 
The reasonableness of the price proposed has to be established by 
taking into account the competition observed from the response of the 
trade to the enquiry, last purchase price, estimated value as given in the 
indent, database maintained on costs based on the past contracts entered 
into, market price, wherever available and changes in the indices of 
various raw materials, electricity, whole sale price index, and statutory 
 changes in wages, rates etc. 
(d) 
For procurement of spare parts, consumables and small value 
contracts which are supplied in the past, the price reasonableness can be 
determined after comparing with last purchase price and factoring in 
 changes in price indices published by the Government sources. 
(e) 
The reasonableness of price may also be examined by resorting to 
Cost Analysis in situations where there is a wide variance over the LPP, 
 not explained by corresponding changes in indices.   
(f) 
Effort should be made to check cost break up details as per format 
  of cost-analysis given in Form DPM-25, to the extent possible.   
  
129
 13.5 Last Purchase Price (LPP) 
13.5.1 Last Purchase Price as a determinant of reasonable price: LPP is one 
of the relevant factors in deciding price reasonableness.  However, 
following needs to be considered while comparing the quoted rates with 
the LPP: 
 
(a) 
LPP of more than three years vintage is not a real scale for 
comparison.  However, such LPP could be used as an input for assessing 
the rates by adding yearly escalation, if considered necessary. The rate of 
escalation may differ from case to case depending on the type of goods 
being procured. This escalation factor should be carefully worked out on 
the basis of data of past purchases of the same/similar items or as per the 
Pricing Policy Agreements, if any. The escalation factor should be worked 
out by Procuring Agencies of the Services after mutual consultation so 
that different escalation factors are not applied by different Procuring 
Agencies for the same/ similar items and in respect of the same source or 
should be worked out as per pricing policy where such pricing IGA is in 
 place. 
(b) 
LPP should pertain to a past successfully executed order of similar 
 magnitude and scope of supply. 
(c) 
Factors like basket price and bulk discount offered need to be taken 
 in to account while using LPP as a scale for comparing prices. 
(d) 
Price variation clause, if any, and the final cost paid by the user in 
 respect of last purchase to which LPP pertains needs to be considered. 
(e) 
Factors like items supplied against LPP being of current production 
 or ex-stock supply need to be taken into account. 
(f) 
Market conditions and other factors like re-starting production lines 
 due to obsolescence may also have to be considered. 
(g) 
Where no other option to assess reasonable rate is feasible, LPP of 
more than three year vintage may also be taken into account but such 
 situations should be rare. 
 13.6 Adoption of Discounted Cash Flow Technique (DCF)  
13.6.1 Discounted Cash Flow: The Discounted Cash Flow is defined in the 
Glossary of Management Accounting Terms, published by the Institute of 
Cost and Works Accountants of India, as “the method of evaluation by 
which cash flow of the future are discounted to current levels by the 
application of a discount rate with a view to reducing all cash flow to 
common denomination and make comparison”.  DCF is also defined as “a 
  
130
method of investment appraisal under which today’s cash outflows are 
  compared with today’s cash inflows” 
13.6.2 Net Present Value Analysis: The Net Present Value (NPV) is a variant of 
DCF method, which is to be used for evaluation of tender. The NPV of a 
contract is equal to the sum of the present values of all the cash flows 
associated with it. The following formula is to be used for calculating NPV 
  of a tender bid: 
 
NPV = Σ _An_ 
 
 
 
   (1+i)t 
  
Where: 
   
NPV  = Net Present Value 
            A         = Expected cash flow for the period mentioned by the subscript 
I 
 = Rate of interest or discounting factor 
 
T 
 = The period after which payment is done 
N         = Payment Schedule as per the payment terms and conditions 
 
 
When choosing among the various bids for the contract, the bid with the 
lowest NPV should be selected. 
 
13.6.3 Steps involved in NPV: The application of NPV analysis in defence 
procurement would involve the following five steps: 
  
Step 1: Selection of the discount rate 
 
Step 2: Identifying the cash out flows to be considered in the analysis 
 
Step 3: Establishing the timing of the cash outflow 
 
Step 4: calculating the NPV of each alternative 
 
Step 5: Selecting the offer with the least NPV 
 
13.6.4 Discounting Rate: Discounting rate to be used under the method is to be 
the lending rate of the Government of India on loans given to the State 
Governments. These rates are notified by the Budget Division of Ministry 
of Finance annually.  
 
13.6.5 Models for structuring cash flows: Following are the suitable models for 
structuring cash flows for tenders/bids: 
   
  
131
 
(a) Structuring cash flows for tenders/bids received in the same 
currency 
 
 
(i) The first step would be to exclude the unknown variables like escalation 
factors etc while determining the cash flows. 
  
(ii) Thereafter the cash out flow expected as per the contract schedule 
from different tenders should be taken into consideration and where the 
cash out flows are not available from the tender documents, the same 
should be obtained from the vendors. 
  
(iii) Once the out flows of different tenders become available, NPV of 
different tenders is to be calculated using the formula given above and the 
one with the lowest NPV is to be selected. 
  
(b) Structuring cash flows for tenders/bids received in different 
currencies 
  
(i) Where bids are received in different currencies/combination of 
currencies, the cash out flow may be brought to a common denomination 
in rupees by adopting a base exchange rate as on the day of opening of 
price bid. Thereafter, the procedure as described above in the case of 
tender bids received in the same currency should be applied to arrive at 
NPV. Conversion of foreign currency bid into rupees is to be done by 
taking into account the BC selling rate of the Parliament Street Branch of 
State Bank of India, New Delhi on the date of the opening of the Price bid.   
  
(ii) Any standard software, pre-loaded as part of a personal computer 
could be used for NPV analysis.  
  
13.6.6 When is the DCF to be used?: The alternative with the smallest payment 
of net present value in the procurement is the obvious choice.  The DCF 
may be made use of to facilitate determination of L1 in following 
procurement situations:  
 
(a) 
To compare different payment terms of the vendors to a common 
 denomination for determining L1 status. 
(b) 
To deal with the cases where entering into AMC over a period of 10 
 to 11 years is part of the contract for evaluating for L1 status. 
13.6.7 Determination by adding Arithmetic Values: Determination of L1 by 
merely adding arithmetic values spread over 12 to 13 years (2 years 
warranty and 10 to 11 year AMC) would be an incorrect procedure for 
determining L1 and the correct procedure would be to reduce cash out 
flows into present values through the DCF technique, for which the 
discount rate to be adopted should form part of the RFP. 
  
132
  
 13.7 Analysis of offers from Foreign Suppliers 
13.7.1 (Analysis of offers: Apart from the parameters enumerated earlier in this 
Chapter regarding analysis, cost break up and price indices wherever 
feasible, efforts should be made to analyze: 
 
(a) 
The price fixation procedure/methodology prevailing in the country 
 of the vendor. 
(b) 
The prices of similar products, systems and subsystems wherever 
available should be referred. The database maintained in the respective 
division connected with the procurement of such type of stores should be 
accessed. 
 
13.7 2 The foreign vendor may be asked to provide the details of past supplies 
and contract rates, if any, of similar kind of product to other buyers. DRDO 
and Production Agencies should be involved in assessing the 
reasonability of prices in such cases of high value. 
 
 13.8 Data Base to be maintained 
13.8.1 Data Base on Cost & Prices: Each service HQrs, should ideally have a 
costing expert who would advise on reasonableness of price, escalation 
clauses, cost verification where prices are fixed subject to a ceiling price.  
Service HQrs, OFB and DRDO should maintain data base on past 
contracts showing details of items procured, their essential spec(s), unit 
rate, quantity, total value, mode of TE, number of tenders received, 
number of tenders considered acceptable, reasons for exclusion of 
overlooked tenders, un-negotiated rates of L1 and contract rates in order 
to help in ascertaining reasonability of prices of future procurements.    
  
13.8.2 Price Indices: For price indices, internet should be accessed by officers 
dealing with purchases/associated with CNC from important sites. In 
regard to price indices of indigenous items, website of Ministry of Industry 
www.eaindustry.nic.in should be accessed for the latest indices/trends.  
For metals and other minerals access www.mmr.online.com for updates.  
The 
other 
useful 
sites 
are 
www.tradintelligence.com 
and 
www.cmie.com.  The monthly report of CMIE (Centre for Monitoring 
Indian Economy). PROWESS Package of CMIE giving updates on 
performance of listed Indian companies, RBI monthly bulletin, Economic 
survey and its Appendix containing statistical tables are excellent 
reference material for market trends.  The World Economic Outlook – a 
monthly report from IMF, gives inputs on price trends of different 
countries.  LME (London Metal Exchange) gives price trends of nonferrous 
details, which often show volatile trends. Indices of electronic items often 
show lower trends. Instructions issued by Ministry of Finance on its web 
  
133
site www.finmin.nic.in should be assessed as also CVC’s site 
www.cvc.nic.in. Important publications like RBI Monthly Bulletin, CMIE’S 
monthly report, business/commercial newspapers, MMR etc should be 
subscribed to. 
  
13.8.3 Expert Agencies: Expert agencies may be approached for market 
intelligence forecasting trends and best practices.  Public Sector Banks, 
particularly SBI, may be consulted before firming up major payments 
involving LC, Performance Bank Guarantee, reputation of foreign banks 
etc. 
 
13.8.4 General Analysis of Financial/Cost Ratios: In assessing the 
reasonableness, general analysis of Financial/Cost ratios from published 
accounts and evaluation of Commercial/Technical information of the 
Vendor/Bidder may be undertaken.  The allocation of overheads should be 
as per established principles of costing.  Assessment should be made on 
the vendor’s approach to controlling cost, adherence to delivery schedule, 
Cost Accounting System and other factors affecting contractor’s ability to 
meet cost/schedule targets. 
  
13.8.5 Data Sharing: The Service Headquarters must put in place a system for 
data sharing and data networking, both within the Service and among the 
Services in order to widen the procurement sources and obviate different 
prices being paid for the same item by different Procuring Agencies within 
a Service or Procuring Agencies of different Services. 
 
13.8.6 Transparency in assessment process: Assessing of reasonableness of 
price is an arduous task, especially where price data is not available or in 
case of overseas purchases.  In such cases, it is important to place on 
record efforts made for arriving at the acceptable price and taking the 
procurement decision.

CHAPTER 14 
 
OFFLOADING OF PARTIAL/ COMPLETE REFITS/REPAIRS OF 
SHIPS/ SUBMARINES/CRAFTS/ASSETS TO INDIAN 
PSU/PRIVATE SHIP YARDS/TRADE 
 
14.1 General  
14.1.1   A ship/submarine is a platform that consists of an assortment of 
weapons, sensors and support systems, along with propulsion, power 
generation and auxiliary systems, facilities for crew and fuel and 
provisions. All the surveillance and weapon systems are interlinked and 
integrated through an elaborate data management system. The platform 
as a whole or a part thereof is required to be refitted/repaired from time to 
time, including inter alia, disassembly, docking, inspection/survey, 
repair/overhaul followed by trials in harbour and at sea. As an integral part 
of the refit process, approved modifications to structure, equipment, 
machinery and systems including installation of new equipment are also 
carried out. Overall, the partial /complete refit of a ship/submarine/ yard 
craft is a complex activity, wherein concerted planning is required much 
before the commencement of the repairs/refit and also during the course 
of the repairs/refit to ensure completion in a time bound manner and make 
the platform seaworthy and battle worthy. Repair of Marine Assets/Service 
Assets also involve the same kind of planning as required for undertaking 
repairs/refits of Ships/Submarines. The entire activity is different from 
other revenue procurement activity, such as, procurement of goods and 
stores or even other services, since a number of technical issues are 
required to be addressed, including visits by the bidders to the 
ship/submarine /assets to be repaired/ refitted. For the purpose of clarity, 
the 
following 
definitions 
would 
be 
used 
in 
respect 
of 
ships/submarines/crafts/assets and their associated repairs/refits:- 
 
(a) 
Refit: 
Includes 
all 
activities 
towards 
servicing 
of 
equipment/refurbishment/ renovation/modification including inter alia 
planned dry docking to attain designed/stated performance. 
(b) 
Repair: 
Includes 
all 
activities, 
where 
a 
defect/anomaly 
in 
performance/degradation in performance of equipment necessitates 
remedial measures on the stated equipment.  
(c) 
Marine Assets:    All assets including yard crafts, boats, barges 
(both dumb and self propelled), Battle Practice Targets (BPTs), Pontoons, 
Catamarans, Floating Dry Docks, Dock Gates, Caissons, Flap Gates, etc 
which come in direct contact with the Marine Environment are Marine 
Assets. 
  
135
(d) 
Service Assets: All assets other than Marine Assets including Jetty 
Cranes, Mobile Cranes, Listers, Trailors, Mobile Generators, Mobile 
Chilling Plants, Forklifts, Workshop Machinery, etc, non-availability of 
which either directly or indirectly affect the productivity of a unit are 
Service Assets.  
(e) 
Competent Technical Authority(CTA): The CTA is the head of 
the Service Repair Agency under the relevant CFA.  
(f) 
Service Repair Agency. The agency of the Navy/Coast Guard 
whose job is to execute the maintenance and/or the maintenance policy of 
the ship/submarine/yard craft  
(g) 
Post Defectation Demand (PDD) Spares. The spares required for 
completion of repairs/refit, which are evident only upon opening 
up/dismantling of the equipment/system and can normally not be foreseen 
at the time of formulation of scope of work.  
 14.2 Aim 
14.2.1 The aim of this chapter is to lay down guidelines for offloading of 
partial/complete repairs/refits of ships/submarines/ assets to Indian 
PSU/Private ship repair yards/trade owing to the unique nature of 
repairs/refits necessitating a distinct procedure. The succeeding 
paragraphs enumerate the detailed guidelines to be followed in the 
refits/repairs of ships/submarines/crafts and the procedure for repair of all 
Marine/Service assets.  
 
14.3 Preamble 
14.3.1 Refits of Ships/Submarines.    Refits of ships/submarines are scheduled 
in accordance with the Ops-cum-Refit cycles promulgated for each class 
of ship. The refit schedules for a Two – Three year period (as the case 
may be for CG and Navy, respectively) are decided during the Annual 
Refit Conference (ARC) chaired by COM (Navy) and PDFM (CGHQ), 
respectively.  The proposals for off loading of refits due to constraint of 
capacity/expertise are discussed and approved during the ARC. 
 
14.3.2 Tendering: All partially/ fully off loaded refits/repairs may be undertaken 
on OTE/LTE basis. To save hidden costs on fuel consumption, 
administrative expenses, support infrastructure requirements, etc in 
offloading the refit/repair work to shipyards located away from the base 
port, LTE to the shipyards in the immediate geographical vicinity of the 
ship’s base and those shipyards willing to undertake the refit in such 
vicinity, may be considered. In case, the response from these shipyards is 
poor, quotes may be invited from other shipyards to undertake the 
repairs/refits at the location specified by the Customer.  
  
136
 
 
 14.4 Off loading of Partial/Complete Refits/Repairs of Ships/Submarines 
14.4.1  Procedure. The stages involved in offloading of partial/ complete 
repairs/refit of ships/submarines are enumerated in the succeeding 
paragraphs. 
 
14.4.2 Consolidated AON. The Service Repair Agency would put up a 
comprehensive plan for offloading that will include the following:- 
 
(a)      Cases approved for off-loading during ARC. 
(b) 
Schedule of Refits being off-loaded. 
(c) 
Rough Indicative Cost (RIC) of approved cases. 
 
14.4.3 Offloading Plan. 
The cases for off-loading will be consolidated into the 
offloading plan with the under mentioned parts. The off loading plan (Roll-
On Basis) would serve as an indicator of the estimated spread of 
expenditure and anticipated budget requirement for the next two to three 
years. 
 
Part A. 
Consolidated cases that would individually be processed 
under delegated powers of ASDs/CSY/COMDISs for the 
ensuing year. 
Part B. 
Consolidated cases that would individually be processed 
under delegated powers of CinCs/COMCGs for the next two 
years. 
Part C. 
Consolidated cases that would individually be processed 
under delegated powers of VCNS/DGICG for the next 
two/three years. 
Part D. 
Consolidated cases that would individually be processed 
under delegated powers of MoD for the next two/three years 
in respect of Coast Guard and Navy respectively. 
 
14.4.4 RIC. The RIC for approved cases would be roll-on in nature and under the  
following heads:- 
 
(a) Major Engineering Work Package 
(b) Major Electrical & Weapon Work Package 
(c) Major Hull Work Package 
(d) Major Equipment Replacement/upgradation 
(e) Services 
(f) Material and Spares 
  
137
 
14.4.5 The AON for the offloading plan would be accorded by the CFA based on 
the financial implication of the individual cases. For instance, the AON for 
Part B of the offloading plan would be accorded by the respective 
CinC/COMCG (even if the consolidated financial implications exceed the 
delegated financial powers). The financial consultation for each part of the 
offloading plan would be given by the concerned IFA of respective CFA. 
The AON would be accorded for the cases to be processed at the 
indicated cost and valid for the period of consolidation on a roll-on basis. 
On accord of AON for the entire offloading plan, the same would be 
forwarded to all concerned CFAs and IFAs for record by Navy/Coast 
Guard. The AON would be accorded for the Standard RFP and SCOC 
placed at Appendix G and Appendix H.  The work package should be 
firmed up prior to  issuance of the RFP, in order to incorporate a realistic 
estimate of Scope of Work. 
 
14.4.6  After the accord of AON, the RFP for individual cases, with firmed up 
work package, would be issued by the respective Service Repair 
Agencies, as and when due. The Scope of Work (SOW) would be 
enclosed with the RFP. The RFP would be issued by the CFA or by the 
agency (which may be NDs/NSRYs in the case of Navy) and 
(BMUs/Station HQs/DHQs/RHQs in the case of Coast Guard) duly 
authorised in writing by the CFA. 
 
14.4.7  In case of any deviation from the standard RFP or upward revision of the 
estimated cost, the case along with the revised draft RFP would be 
forwarded for vetting and approval of CFA in consultation with IFA where 
required as per delegation of financial powers. Variations from Standard 
RFP and SCOC for individual cases can still be part of the Roll-On Plan, in 
which case, those specific cases are to be accorded separate AONs along 
with the variations in the RFP and SCOC. 
 
14.4.8  All emergent cases due to service exigencies may be taken up for AON of 
he CFA separately. In such cases, if the financial implication of the off 
loading case is beyond the powers of the immediate CFA, then the SOC 
along with the draft RFP will be sent directly to the next higher CFA duly 
recommended for vetting and approval. Concurrence of the intermediate 
IFA is not required, as the case would be dealt with exclusively by the next 
higher IFA.  
 
 14.5 Receipt and Processing of Bids 
14.5.1 Pre Bid Conference. Pre-bid discussions may be held prior to submission 
of bids for clarification of issues related to the SOW.  However where the 
repair/refit project involves firming up of technical issues prior to issue of 
RFP, in such cases, a Request for Information (RFI) Conference may be 
held with prospective Tenderers followed by issue of a formal RFP.       
  
138
The RFP would be issued only to those vendors who satisfy the pre-
qualification criterion.  
 
14.5.1 TEC. On submission of the bids, the TEC would be conducted by the 
agency nominated by the CFA and the TEC report is to be forwarded to 
the CFA. The TEC is not authorized to discuss commercial aspects of the 
case. However, the TEC should prepare a compliance statement in 
respect of commercial terms and conditions, such as bid security, 
warranty, etc. included in the technical bid as per the RFP. While IFA need 
not participate in the TEC, CFA may, if considered necessary, evolve a 
system of associating the IFA or his representative in examination of the 
TEC report in regard to compliance with the commercial terms and 
conditions before opening of price/ ‘Q’ Bids.  
 
14.5.2 Processing of ‘T’ Bid. The off loading case will thereafter be processed 
concurrently for the following:- 
 
(a) 
Approval of TEC Report. 
 
(b) 
Composition of Tender Opening Committee (TOC) for opening ‘Q’ 
Bids. 
 
14.5.3 Processing of Price Bid. The TOC will open the Q Bids and prepare the 
Comparative Statement of Tenders (CST). The case along with the CST is 
to be re-submitted to the CFA for approval in consultation with IFA for the 
 following:-  
(i) 
Vetting of CST by IFA 
 
(ii) 
Composition of CNC 
 
14.5.4 CNC. The L1 firm would be invited to the CNC meeting. All aspects of 
Contract and Financial implications thereof would be discussed and 
finalised during the CNC.  
 
14.5.5 Approval by CFA. Thereafter, the case is to be processed for concurrent 
approval of CNC minutes/report, Draft Contract and Sanction Letter by the 
CFA in consultation with IFA.  
 
 14.6  Offloading of Marine / Service Assets  
14.6.1 Repairs/Refit of Marine Assets. The procedure for complete/partial 
repairs of Marine/Service assets is the same as given in Paras in 14.4 to 
14.5 above, except that the offloading plan in the case of Marine/Service 
assets would be annual.  
 
  
139
14.7 Characteristic Features of Refits/Repair  
14.7.1 Growth of Work.  The SOW in refits of ships/submarines are usually non-
deterministic and dynamic in nature with regard to resources required for 
completion. The growth of work, a feature typical of refits/repairs, is 
dependent inter alia on factors such as Age of Ship/Submarine, Condition 
of onboard Equipment/machinery, Condition of Hull, role and exploitation 
pattern, duration between formulation of work package and actual 
execution of work, modifications and Additions & Alterations. Additional 
financial sanction up to 15% of Contract Value would be catered for such 
Growth of Work. Payment in all such cases will be made at actuals subject 
to the respective ceiling stipulated for the Navy and Coast Guard. A Post 
Refit Report would be drawn up for distribution to all concerned including 
the IFA.   
Note:   In case of Coast Guard, the present practice is to allow a component 
up to 15% of Contract Value towards Growth of Work and up to 20% of 
Contract Value towards Non-available Spares. This practice may continue for 
the present.   
Growth of work would be costed on pro-rata costs quoted by the Bidder and 
accepted during CNC. Wherever, pro-rata rates are not available, the prices 
would be negotiated by the COA in consultation with the IFA. 
14.8 Payment Terms 
14.8.1  Stages of Payment. The Stage Payments are to be specified in the RFP 
for complete/partial offloading of repairs/refit and are to be commensurate 
with the work undertaken by the yard. The number of stages and payment 
terms would vary from case to case depending on duration of the project 
and cost involved and are to be incorporated in the RFP.  The 
recommended stage payment terms for complete refit may be as follows:- 
  
 (a) Refit Cost 
(i)     Stage – I. 10% advance of basic contracted refit cost against 
bank guarantee / indemnity bond (in case of DPSUs) on placement 
 of order/contract. 
(ii) 
Stage – II. 10% of the basic contracted refit cost on docking 
 (excluding taxes and Growth of Work)  
(iii) 
Stage – III. 20% of the basic contracted refit cost on final 
 undocking and completion of all under water works  
  
140
(iv) 
Stage IV. 20% of the basic contracted refit cost on 
satisfactory completion of Basin Trials and harbour trials of major 
machinery/ equipment (such as Main Propulsion Plant, Shafting 
and equipment related to Habitability) 
 
(v) 
Stage – V. 20% of the basic contracted refit cost minus cost 
of all incomplete work on satisfactory completion of post refit Sea 
trials and departure of the ship from the shipyard. Cost of 
 incomplete work will be withheld till completion of work. 
(vi) 
Stage VI. Balance along with cost for Growth of Work and 
taxes on submission of final bill within sixty (60) days on 
satisfactory completion of Refit. Shipyard to provide a bank 
guarantee equal to 10% of the final cost of refit/repair (indemnity 
bond in case of DPSUs), which should be valid till the completion of 
 the guarantee/warranty period. 
Note:-   All stage and final bill payments are to be vetted and 
 cleared by COA. 
(b) 
Material and Spares.   Advance on signing of Contract of up 
to 10% of cost of spares, against Bank Guarantee may be 
permitted. The remaining payment for spares would be made along 
with the stage payments during refit duration, on submission of 
proof of Purchase order, Material receipt and Inward inspection. 
Handling charges, if any, are to be restricted to a maximum of 
7.5%.  
 
14.9 Loading in Case of Defect List Items “Not Quoted”.   In order to ensure 
that all offers are compared in an equitable and fair manner, loading would 
be resorted to for determining the L1. During this process the bids with 
unresponsive sections/sub-sections would be loaded by the amount 
quoted by the highest bidder for that particular section/sub-section for 
preparing CST. The Bid shall be deemed to be responsive only if the firm 
accepts the loading in writing.  
14.10  Criterion for Determination of L1 Firm. The L1 Firm would be 
determined as follows:- 
(a) 
Navy.    The Cost of Refit, Services and Budgetary Cost of Spares 
listed in the work package would be taken into account for determination 
of L1.  Payment for such mandatory spares shall not exceed the budgetary 
cost given in the ‘Q’ bid. 
(b) 
Coast Guard.  In case of Coast Guard, since mandatory spares 
are not part of Refit Package, determination of L1 Firm would be 
considered on account of Cost of Refit inclusive of Services. 
  
141
14.11 Request for Proposal. The repairs/refits of ships/submarines/assets are 
distinct from other procurement cases and warrant a separate 
standardised RFP (placed at Appendix G).  
14.12 Standard Conditions of Contract. Standard Conditions of Contract 
(SCoC) owing to distinct nature of such contracts is placed at  
Appendix H.  
14.13 PCM. Approval of CFA and concurrence of IFA where required as per 
delegation of financial powers will be taken in all cases of post contractual 
changes/amendments to the Contract.

CHAPTER 15 
 
DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT AND FABRICATION CONTRACTS 
 
 15.1  Introduction 
15.1.1 General.  This Chapter lays down the procedures to be followed by 
the Defence authorities and Departments for conclusion of contracts for 
design, indigenous development (including indigenization) and fabrication 
of stores, equipment and spares required by the Defence Services.  The 
general instructions contained herein have been made as flexible as 
possible to avoid time delays and to encourage the industry to come 
forward and undertake the design, development and fabrication of items, 
equipment, plant and machinery required by the Defence Services.  
Detailed Instructions on Procedures to be followed in-house for processing 
orders for items of a developmental nature/indigenisation may be drawn 
by the Services HQrs/ other development agencies like DRDO, CPOs etc. 
in consultation with the MoD (Finance) in broad consonance with the 
 guidelines contained herein. 
15.1.2 
Decision 
for 
Indigenous 
Development. 
The 
Technical 
Directorate/ Directorate of Indigenisation /Committee for Indigenisation of 
the concerned Service/ Department/ Command HQ should assess the 
economic viability of indigenous manufacture of a defence item in the civil 
sector in terms of volume, likelihood of future requirement and economies 
of scale, residual life of the equipment/item and a clear indication of 
requirement over a long period (of say 3-5 years). For this purpose 
necessary systemic changes in planning and provisioning may be carried 
out by the Services. In case the above conditions are not fulfilled, the 
feasibility of indigenising a package of similar range of items may be 
considered / decided by the CFA in consultation with the IFA keeping in 
view the volume, future requirement and economies of scale so as to 
make the package commercially viable. If it is not feasible to work out a 
package but the item is still required to be indigenised for strategic 
reasons, the requirement may be projected to the Department of Defence 
Production and Supplies for development by the OFB/Defence PSUs etc.  
 where feasible.  
15.1.3 Partnership with Private Sector. The Indian private sector 
Industry today offers scope for their greater involvement in the Defence 
Sector and possesses the requisite skills and infrastructure for 
undertaking defence production or may be willing to invest/share the cost 
of setting up of such infrastructure. The industry should be encouraged to 
make such investment by working out the Minimum Order Quantity to 
maintain the financial viability of development within the desired time 
  
143
schedules. As regards high technology complex systems, projects under 
this category should be identified, to be undertaken by Raksha Udyog 
Ratnas (RURs) /Indian Industry /DPSUs /OFB/ Consortia on a level 
playing field. This procedure may also be followed for all upgradations of 
equipment/parts under the ‘Make’ category. Outsourcing of development 
of equipment /systems having high technology content should be 
considered on the lines of parallel development for which the cost should 
 be shared with the vendor. 
 15.2 Principles and Policy  
15.2.1 General Principles.  Whilst it is not possible to lay down any rigid 
rules covering all the contingencies that may arise in the finalisation of 
specific development contracts, the following guiding principles may, 
 however, be borne in mind :- 
(a)    Exploration of sources for placement of development order 
should be as wide as possible, both in the public and private sector, 
 to encourage competition.  
(b)     Ability of the contractor to execute work of the desired quality 
to the required time schedule should be evaluated by a Technical 
 Committee.   
(c)     Development contracts may, as far as feasible, be concluded 
with two or more contractors in parallel, subject to the other 
vendor/s agreeing to match the price of L1. In case of higher 
deviation the full / Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) order may be 
placed on the L1 firm, subject to price being found reasonable.   
 
(d) 
Placing of parallel contracts on two parties is particularly 
necessary/desirable to have more than one source of supply at bulk 
production stage and also, apart from competition, to ensure 
successful completion of development if one of the contractors fails 
to develop the equipment in time.   
 
(e)   The ratio of splitting of the supply order between various 
development agencies/firms in cases of parallel development, 
 including criteria thereof, must be pre-disclosed in the RFP itself.  
(f)    However, in case the requirement is meager and complex 
technology is involved, a single source having expertise in the 
requisite field may be considered with appropriate justification and 
due approval of the CFA in consultation with IFA where required as 
per delegation of financial powers. 
 
 
  
144
(g) 
The contractor or the firm should be such that it can, if so 
 desired, take up bulk production orders subsequently.   
(h) 
During the developmental stage, 20% of the total order 
quantity may be earmarked for development. This would, however, 
not be considered as a case of dual procurement. 
 
 
(i) 
The information available with the DGS&D and the Defence 
Inspection Organisation (DGQA, DGNAI and DGAQA) may be 
availed of in selecting the firms to be entrusted with the 
 development/fabrication contracts. 
 (j) 
Items 
indented 
by 
the 
indenting 
authority 
through 
indents/Final Depot List/ Special Requisition should be the basis to 
proceed with the development after requisite quantity vetting has 
been done, as per laid down procedure.  
 
15.2.2 Processing of Development Orders.  Some of the important 
 steps involved in the processing of development contracts are as follows :- 
(a) 
Identification/Selection 
of 
stores/items 
for 
indigenous 
 development. 
(b) 
Generation of the Paper Particulars / drawings. 
(c) 
Identification of vendors/firms. 
(d) 
Framing and Issue of RFP. 
(e) 
Technical evaluation of bids and holding of CNC/PNC. 
(f) 
Conclusion of Contract/ Supply Order. 
(g) 
Post Contract Management. 
 
15.2.3 Selection of Items for indigenization/development.  The 
following broad guidelines may be adopted to arrive at the decision for 
 indigenous development of items/equipment :- 
(a) 
When OEM is closing down or has closed down the 
production line and spares are not available ex-import for 
equipment which has adequate residual life and population.  
 
(b) 
Items for which TOT has been taken.    
 
(c) 
Items including those which are low tech and the sample is 
available and which it would be economic to develop. 
 
  
145
(d) 
Spares which are fast moving and the requirement is 
recurring in nature. 
 
(e) 
Goods for which the import price is exorbitant. 
 
(f) 
Items short-listed from MRLS and import list depending upon 
their criticality, technological processes involved and 
consumption rate. 
 
(g)  
Where an Indian firm offers to develop an item on ‘No Cost : 
No Commitment’ basis. 
 
(h) 
In special cases, where it is considered in the interest of the 
State to indigenize or for any other strategic reason to be 
recorded, e.g. Secrecy devices. 
 
15.2.4  Dispensation to firms undertaking Development Contracts. The 
contract documents may be issued free of cost. Further, submission of 
earnest money deposit and security deposit may not be made mandatory 
in case of firms of repute/firms which are registered with DGS&D, 
DGQA/DGAQA or other Departments/Services on case to case basis. . 
Development orders placed on firms may not have a liquidated damage 
clause, if it is found difficult to attract vendors to develop the item/ stores 
whose specification is normally not governed by any widely used 
standards like IS/BS, etc. 
  
 15.3  Paper Particulars and Design Aspects  
15.3.1  Model. Development contracts are generally of the following 
two types:- 
 
(a) 
Those where industrial engineering of Prototype models is to 
be done by the firm on the complete design data which has already 
been evolved in the Establishment/Department by the design and 
development of an existing/original model.   
 
(b) 
Those where designing, developing and engineering are 
completely done by a firm under technical guidance and advice 
from the developmental authorities.  In this case, it may be possible 
to utilize the expertise available in the industry and ensure quick 
and smooth supply.   
 
15.3.2 Design Aspects.  In the case of contracts as at Para 15.3.1(a) 
above, the development contract would always be based on a draft 
technical / design specification and other information to be provided by the 
Establishment / Dte of Indigenisation/ Laboratory / Workshop / Depot.  In 
  
146
case of contracts as at Para 15.3.1 (b) above, the contract should contain 
a 
provision 
for 
the 
development 
of 
industrially 
engineered 
models/equipment and supply of models/equipment at various stages with 
relevant types of drawing and other documents by the contractor, as 
required by the contracting authority.  The design material, workmanship 
and performance of the equipment for a specific period should also be 
guaranteed by the contractor.   
 
 15.4   Vendor Identification / Development 
15.4.1 Identification of Vendors.  Identification of appropriate vendors is a vital 
step and must be well considered. Wherever possible, the vendors who 
are 
registered 
with 
DGAQA/DGQA/DRDO/OFs/ 
DPSUs/Services 
indigenisation agencies/ NSIC should be approached. Suitable vendors 
can also be identified by the developing agency in consultation with other 
developing agencies apart from firms registered with DGQA or any other 
defence establishment. Unregistered firms may be considered taking into 
account their infrastructural facilities, capacity, technical competence and 
financial standing. A format for this purpose is enclosed at Form                  
DPM - 5.  Firms of national repute may also be considered based on self-
 certification, with the approval of the Defence Secretary. 
 15.4.2  Development of Source by Inviting Applications for Enlistment.    
 The following procedure will be followed:- 
a) 
Open advertisement will be placed on the internet and 
advertised in leading newspapers every year, in respect of different 
products/components, for enlisting firms willing to participate in 
tenders issued by the Department/Organisation.  The minimum 
number of products/components required to be submitted by the 
vendor 
for 
evaluation 
and 
likely 
demand 
for 
those 
products/components for the next two to three years will be 
 indicated in the advertisement. 
b) 
Interested firms may visit the factory/workshop/depot as 
indicated in the tender to see the product/ component required to 
be developed.  Thereafter, the firms showing interest in developing 
the product/component should be asked to submit the details of 
infrastructure available with them, as per the documents prescribed 
 for vendor registration; 
c) 
The infrastructure details submitted by the firms should be 
studied by a team of officers constituted to assess their 
manufacturing capability to verify their genuine potential for 
 developing the product/ component. 
  
147
d) 
Firms found capable of developing the product/component 
should be asked to submit the required number of samples (as 
advertised) of the identified product(s).  On acceptance of samples, 
the firm will be eligible for participating in the LTEs for the said 
 component / product. 
e) 
A firm may not be willing to submit a sample due to 
requirement of a heavy investment. In such cases, the 
indigenisation agency / Directorate may place a development order 
 on the firm as follows :- 
 
(i) 
The cost of the sample will be assessed through a 
Board of Officers having representation from Finance. 
 
 
(ii) 
The firm will be asked to offer a quotation and if the 
price is found to be equal to or lower than the assessed cost, 
the development order will be placed on the firm at the price 
quoted. 
  
(iii) 
If the firm quotes a price higher than the assessed 
cost, the price will be negotiated with the firm and 
development order placed at the assessed cost. 
 
15.4.3  Capacity Assessment. Capacity assessment/verification of firms not 
registered with DGQA/DGNAI/DGAQA/Govt Agencies is to be undertaken 
by the developing agency by associating a member from the 
DGQA/DGNAI/DGAQA, other inspection agencies or other Technical 
Agencies/Committees on fast track to ensure that firms identified are 
capable to develop prototype equipment and systems as required. Where 
considered necessary by the CFA, IFA may be associated for assessment 
of the financial capacity of the firm. Once a firm has successfully executed 
an order within +/-5% tolerance both in terms of quality and quantity, it 
 should be encouraged to get registered.  
15.4.4 Transfer of Technology (ToT).   When equipment is being bought from 
a foreign vendor, the provision of ToT to an Indian private/public firm for 
providing maintenance infrastructure may be considered and the foreign 
vendor would need to identify an Indian firm which would be responsible 
for providing base repairs (third line) and the requisite spares for the entire 
life cycle of the equipment. These firms would be DPSUs/OFB/RURs/or 
any other firm specially selected for this purpose. In addition Army Base 
Workshops/Naval Dockyards/Base Repair Depots of Air Force may also 
be considered for this purpose at RFP stage on a case to case basis in 
consultation with the DDP. The RFP would spell out the specific 
requirements of ToT for Maintenance Infrastructure which could cover the 
production of certain spares, establishment of base repair facilities 
including testing facilities and the provision of spares for the entire life 
  
148
cycle of the equipment.  Both the foreign and the Indian firms would be 
jointly responsible for providing the maintenance facilities and support for 
that equipment.  
 
 15.5  Framing and Issue of RFP 
15.5.1 Request for Proposal (RFP).  Development/ indigenisation of an item 
may require design, generation of drawings, manufacturing, development 
of 
prototype 
equipment 
and 
system, 
quality 
assurance 
during 
development process, tests and trials and inspections at various stages.  
RFP is to be floated to firms who have the required infrastructure for the 
proposed development. In order to save on development time and in case 
of the classified nature of stores to be developed, quotations may normally 
be invited on limited tender basis from firms/contractors who are known to 
be capable of undertaking the particular development work.  However, 
depending upon the specific requirements of the case, the developing 
agency may justify issue of RFP either on OTE, LTE or STE basis, as 
required. 
 
15.5.2 Pre-bid Conference.   In case of turnkey contracts or for development of 
sophisticated and complex equipment, a suitable provision is to be made 
in the bidding documents for a pre-bid conference for clarifying issues and 
clearing doubts, if any, about the specification and other technical details 
of the plant, machinery and equipment projected in the bidding document.  
The date, time and place of the Pre-bid Conference must be indicated in 
the bidding document and should be sufficiently ahead of the bid opening 
date. 
 
 15.6 Receipt and Evaluation of Bids 
15.6.1   Bid Opening/Technical Evaluation and CNC. The firms submitting 
their quotation will be intimated the place, date and time for opening of the 
quotation and the bids will be opened at the appointed time by the Board 
of Officers in the presence of the representatives of the firm, if present. 
The procedure for tender opening, technical evaluation, preparation of 
CST and convening of TPC/CNC for commercial evaluation thereof will be 
 as per modality given elsewhere in the relevant Chapters of this DPM.  
15.6.2  Resultant Single Vendor Situation. 
In case of LTE/Open Tender 
invitation if only one firm responds or if only one firm is found by the TEC 
to meet all the specifications, the following aspects will be examined:- 
 
(a) 
Whether all necessary requirements such as Standard 
Tender Enquiry conditions, wide publicity, and sufficient time for 
formulation of tenders had been taken care of while issuing the 
 RFP; 
  
149
(b)   
Whether the RFP was properly dispatched and duly received 
 by the prospective vendors; 
(c) 
Whether SQRs could be re-formulated to generate wider 
 competition. 
(d) 
Whether the price quoted in the bid is considered 
reasonable. 
 
15.6.3   Examination. If the examination reveals that requirements from (a) to (d) 
have been fulfilled the proposal may be processed further as a case of 
OTE/LTE as applicable, with the approval of the CFA, for placement of the 
development order. However, if the quoted price is not borne out as 
reasonable based on benchmarking prior to opening of the commercial bid 
or if the offer is not technically feasible or firm not considered capable of 
developing the item, the bid should be retracted with the approval of the 
CFA 
 
15.6.4    Reasonableness of  Price.  
It would be mandatory for the vendor to 
submit the detailed break-up of cost under the headings materials 
(indigenous/ imported, quantity, cost), labour (number of man hours, man 
hour rates, etc.), design and development, drawings and details of 
overheads which will be vetted by a technical team of the Department 
/Organisation. The last purchase price (LPP) of imported item will be taken 
as the base price to arrive at the reasonableness of the quoted rates. In 
case LPP is not available the base price will be arrived at by the process 
of benchmarking which will be done prior to opening of the Commercial 
bid as per the procedure given in Chapter 13 of the DPM. L1 will be 
determined with reference to the development cost, including the cost of 
prototype and the total quantity for which the initial orders are placed. An 
indication of the quantities that would be required during the next two to 
three years should also be given in the RFP. 
 
 15.7  TYPES OF CONTRACTS 
15.7.1  Adoption of Contract Type.  
Various types of contracts can be 
adopted depending upon the nature, complexity and time span of the 
development work /project. These are described below. However, 
normally Firm-Fixed-Price contracts, Fixed Price Contracts with escalation 
clause and Fabrication Contracts will be concluded.  Contracts other than 
these three will be adopted only with the prior approval of Service 
Headquarters/ Head of Organisation /Department /Service / HQ 
Maintenance Command IAF in consultation with the respective IFA.   
  
 
  
150
15.7.2   Firm-Fixed-Price Contract. 
Firm fixed price contract means a 
contract 
in 
which 
a 
lump 
sum 
amount 
is 
agreed 
upon 
for 
development/indigenisation and supply of the equipment based on 
data/specifications supplied and which is not subject to any adjustment 
during the performance of the contract due to any reasons whatsoever.  
The firm or the contractor assumes full financial responsibility in the form 
of profit or loss.  This type of contract is best suited when reasonably 
definite design or performance specification is available and when 
 Government can estimate reasonable price of development/indigenisation.   
15.7.3   Fixed Price Contract with Escalation. This is the same as the firm-
fixed-price contract, except that upward or downward revision of 
contracted price can be allowed on occurrence of certain contingencies 
beyond the control of the firm/contractor such as increase/decrease in 
wages or cost of material.  An escalation formula must be included in such 
contracts and a ceiling of escalation should also be fixed in the case of 
long term contracts. Price variation clause can be provided only in long 
term contracts where the delivery period extends beyond 18 months. The 
conditions prescribed for price variation clause elsewhere in the DPM will 
apply whenever such a clause is included in the developmental contracts. 
 
15.7.4 Fixed Price Contract providing for Re-determination of Price. This 
type of contract is intended to eliminate the impact of contingencies due to 
causes other than those foreseen in the case of fixed price contract with 
escalation.  These contingencies may be due to the contractor’s/firm’s 
unfamiliarity with the raw materials or manufacturing processes, to long 
term contracts, lack of specifications or the use of performance rather than 
product specifications.  In such cases prospective re-determination could 
  be done - 
 
(i) 
On request by either party 
 
(ii) 
At stated intervals 
 
(iii) 
At a determinable time. 
 
15.7.5 Fixed Price Incentive Contract. This type of contract is designed to 
provide a greater incentive to the firm / contractor to reduce the contract 
costs by providing higher profits if costs are reduced and lower profits 
when costs rise.  These costs, the ceilings on target cost, target profit, a 
price ceiling and the formula for arriving at final cost are all settled before 
the execution of the contract.  This contract type will only be applicable for 
ab-initio development contracts. 
 
15.7.6 Cost Plus Contract. Cost Plus contracts should ordinarily be avoided. 
Where such contracts become unavoidable as no vendor is willing to 
undertake the development, full justification should be recorded before 
  
151
entering into the contract. In this type of contract the firm/contractor is 
reimbursed the costs incurred and also receives a negotiated profit for 
performing the contract, i.e., the profit of the firm/contractor and not the 
cost of development is fixed.  Contractor’s responsibility towards cost of 
the item is minimum except that he has to use the same care and 
prudence as is expected under fixed price contracts.  This type of contract 
should be concluded only when the uncertainty which is involved in the 
contract performance is of such a magnitude that the cost of performance 
cannot be estimated with sufficient reasonableness to permit the type of 
fixed price contract. It is also necessary to ascertain that the 
firms/contractors have cost accounting machinery and that the cost is 
clearly defined.  A strict R&D surveillance has got to be provided by the 
Dept to ensure that costs incurred by the firm are reduced to the minimum. 
The RFP should provide for the firm’s books of accounts to be checked by 
the Order Placing Agency to verify the costs by inclusion of a book 
examination clause as per standard format. Where supplies or works have 
to continue over a long duration, efforts should be made to convert future 
contracts on a firm price basis, after allowing a reasonable period to the 
supplier/contractor to stabilise their production methods. 
 
15.7.7  Fabrication Contract. Fabrication contract means a one time contract 
concluded with a contractor or a firm for fabrication and supply of 
component, sub-assemblies or an assembly, which are not commercially 
available, against design drawings/specifications to be supplied by the 
Directorate of Indigenisation/R&D Laboratory/Establishment/Workshop/ 
 Depot /Institution.  
 15.8   Conclusion of Development Contracts 
15.8.1  Conditions for placing Development Contracts. 
The following points 
 will be borne in mind by the authority entering into a contract :- 
 
 (a) 
Contracts in writing should be placed after calling for 
quotations from a number of firms/contractors unless STE is 
resorted to for which detailed justification would be necessary.  The 
two 
bid 
system 
should 
be 
followed 
in 
design/development/fabrication contracts of a complex nature. In 
other cases, a single bid may be invited.  A Pre bid conference may 
be held prior to submission of the tenders to clarify any doubtful 
areas and also to firm up the SQRs/QRs prior to submission of 
 bids.  
(b)   When the statement of case for sanctioning of various phases 
of the project or the indent is put up, the Head of Service or 
Establishment /Director/Purchase Dept concerned should mention 
the amount that is intended to be spent on development/fabrication 
contracts out of the total cost of the project.  At this stage detailed 
  
152
particulars regarding the inquiries made with firms, if any, the 
number of prototypes intended for manufacture and the intention to 
get the prototype manufactured by one or more firms must be 
mentioned.   
 
(c) 
The financial status and technical capability verification 
reports as well as compliance with the techno commercial 
requirements will be taken into account at the TEC stage itself.  ‘Q’ 
 bids of only those firms will be opened who are cleared by the TEC. 
 
(d) 
Ordinarily advance payments need not be agreed to in the 
payment terms.  If, however, advance payments have to be made, 
these should be made against a Bank Guarantee executed on 
proper stamp paper.  If stage payments are to be made to the 
firm/contractor, the stages should be clearly defined and it should 
be ensured that the payments are in consonance with the work 
actually performed by the firm/contractor as per each stage, viz. 
Preliminary, Design Review, Detailed Design Review and 
Realisation of Prototype. The quantum of payment will generally not 
exceed 50% of the estimated expenditure incurred by the 
contractor upto that stage. The yardsticks for work measurement 
 will be laid down in the contract. 
 
(e) 
Once a contract has been concluded, the terms and 
conditions thereof will generally not be varied. However where this 
becomes necessary/inescapable any modification will be carried 
out with the prior concurrence of the appropriate CFA and the 
respective IFA, within whose powers the revised contract value 
 falls. 
(f) 
Whenever stores are required to be issued to the 
firm/contractor for fabrication or prototypes or sub-assemblies are 
issued for guidance in fabrication, these should be issued against 
appropriate Bank Guarantee.  In addition to the Bank Guarantee, 
appropriate insurance may be asked only where it is considered 
necessary.  
 
15.8.2  Standard and Special Conditions. Standard conditions, as in Part III of 
Appendix ‘C’, which are applicable to the contract will only be given to the 
contractor Any special conditions of contract considered necessary shall 
also be drawn out by the Establishment/ Indigenisation Directorate / 
Laboratory / Developing agency/Department concerned and issued to the 
tenderers along with other documents.  The successful bidder will 
conclude an Agreement as per the draft at Appendix I. 
 
  
153
15.8.3  Fabrication Contracts.  The acceptance of quotation in this case 
would take the form of a supply order. Format given in Appendix J for 
fabrication orders will be annexed thereto. 
 
 15.9    Placement of Order   
15.9.1   In case of items considered economically viable for indigenous 
development, the first order may be placed for the Economic Order 
Quantity (EOQ) only, The balance number of items in the indent over and 
above the EOQ may be returned to the indenter and the latter may be 
asked to re-certify the funds for the EOQ only. The indenter may obtain his 
balance requirement, if any through import route or through any other 
sources. Generally a period of two to three years may be provided for 
 indigenous development of a defence item. 
15.9.2 In case the quantity of the equipment/ spares is limited/small and may 
become uneconomic (Non - EOQ) if distributed between two vendors, the 
 entire order would be placed upon the L1 vendor only. 
15.9.3 If the indented quantity is found to be less than the assessed EOQ, the 
Indigenization Agency should first float the RFP and in case there is no 
response, it will not be taken up for indigenization unless its’ development 
is considered essential for strategic reasons. 
 
 15.10   Development of Second/New Sources  
15.10.1 Procedure.  With a view to speeding up development of additional 
indigenous sources, the question of earmarking a prescribed quantity of 
the indent for developing a new source has been considered, and the 
following procedure may be adopted for procurement of items of a 
development nature, particularly for high value indents of Rs 10 Crs and 
 above:- 
 (a) 
Where there is only a single developed source, or where 
there is a felt need for development of more than two sources, 20% 
only of the second indent should be earmarked for placement as an 
educational order on the new source to be developed.  The 
percentage may however be modified to ensure that the quantity 
covered is viable for economic production.  This order for the 
earmarked 20 % should be placed by inviting tenders (OTE/LTE) as 
per the normal procedure laid down, and the source already 
 developed will not participate in this.  
(b)  
The balance 80% of the indent is to be procured from the 
sources already developed. The firms that execute the source 
development orders within 5% tolerance clause will be considered 
  
154
as established source subject to submission of bid for at least 50% 
 quantity of the source development tender.  
(c) 
Pending successful development of a new source, the order 
should be placed on the developed source(s) for the required 
quantity as indented by the Services by following the usual 
procedure laid down in this regard in order to ensure that the 
requirement of Services and of Production are met fully and without 
 any delay.   
(d) 
In case the new source on which the order for 20% of the 
indent was placed fails to develop the item, the order should be 
placed on another new source to be selected by following the usual 
 procedure laid down.   
 (e) 
A second order to an undeveloped source which has 
 secured one order will not be issued unless:- 
 
(i) 
A Bulk Production Clearance (BPC) has been 
accorded to it for the subject item against the first order; and 
  
(ii) 
It has made at least 50% of the supplies of the first 
Supply Order placed on it, which have been duly accepted. 
         
15.10.2 Acquiring Manufacturing Drawings In order to rapidly develop 
alternative sources of supply of an item after this has been developed and 
productionised by one contractor, it is essential that the manufacturing 
drawings are passed on by the contractor to the Govt.  Since the 
manufacturing drawings are evolved and finalised by the contractor who 
has initially developed the item, it is likely that the contractor would claim 
his rights on such drawings and not agree to part with them.  Accordingly, 
a clause should be included in the Tender Enquiry clarifying that the 
manufacturing drawings /tools/ jigs/ fixtures / dyes/moulds prepared by the 
contractor for manufacture of the store required shall be the property of 
the Ministry of Defence and as such shall be passed on to the Purchaser 
and shall not be used by the contractor for any purpose other than this 
contract, without the written consent of the Competent Financial Authority, 
in consultation with the IFA.   
 
15.10.3    Items Developed by Defence PSUs/OFB. The 
cases 
in 
which 
DRDO/ Defence PSUs/OFB /RURs have successfully developed an item 
for the Deptt of Defence or have taken Transfer of Technology (ToT) for 
Department of Defence would not be taken as single vendor cases and 
only a commercial RFP should be issued to them directly. Instead, they 
would be treated at par with the proprietary firms for any subsequent 
procurement, except that no PAC certificate is required. Further, the 
delegated financial powers of CFAs for PAC purchases will be exercised 
  
155
for such procurements.  It will, however, be checked prior to placing of 
orders that the technology absorption levels agreed to while concluding 
the ToT contract have been achieved.  
 
 15.11 Terms of Payment 
15.11.1  General .  The normal terms of payment are 100% payment within 30 
days time after receipt and acceptance of the materials in good condition 
or the date of receipt of supplier’s bill, whichever is later. However, an 
amount of 10% may be withheld as performance guarantee (where 
Security Deposit has not been taken) during the warranty period as 
mutually agreed with the contractor.  
 
15.11.2 Optional. Alternatively, payment upto 90% against proof of dispatch 
taking into consideration aspects like the reputation and past performance 
of the suppliers and pre-inspection of the goods at the suppliers’ premises 
may be considered where necessary.  Such payments for dispatch by 
road will be made only if the goods are at suppliers’ cost.   
 
15.11.3  Advance Payment to Suppliers.   Generally no advance should be 
paid to the firms/contractors and payments for services rendered or 
supplies made should be released only after the services have been 
rendered or supplies made. However, it may become necessary in the 
case of development and fabrication contracts or in case of turnkey 
projects to give an advance. In such cases it should be ensured that only 
a minimum reasonable amount, upto 15%, is given as advance at the time 
of placement of the order.  Such advance payments will be made only 
against furnishing of a proper bank guarantee by the firm from a public 
sector bank or private sector bank duly authorized by RBI to handle 
Government transactions. Format for the Bank Guarantee is given in Form 
DPM-16. 
 
15.11.4  Intermediate Payments. The initial advance paid should be adjusted 
against the successive stage payments due to the supplier. The 
intermediary payments, if any, should be spread over the period of 
execution of the projects/contract and made in suitable installments 
keeping in view various stages of development/manufacture. These 
stages should be pre-determined and it should be ensured that the 
payments made are in consonance with work actually performed by the 
firm/contractor and linked to verifiable milestones viz. Preliminary Design 
Review, Detailed Design Review, purchase of raw materials and 
realisation of prototype etc. The quantum of payment will generally not 
exceed 50% of the estimated expenditure incurred by the contractor upto 
that stage. About 20 to 25% amount as last installment should be released 
only after the completion of the project or rendering of the 
services/supplies to the entire satisfaction of the authority placing the 
order.   
  
156
 
15.11.5 Deviations. Cases of advance payment over and above the limits 
prescribed above would require the approval of the Defence Secretary 
and concurrence of FA (DS)/Secy Def (Finance).   
 
 15.12   Post Contract Management 
15.12.1  Forwarding of Contract Documents. Once 
a 
project 
has 
been 
sanctioned and a contract is concluded for development/fabrication, a 
copy of the contract will be forwarded to the Heads of Technical 
Directorates/Services at Headquarters / AHSP.  Two copies of the 
contract (one for the CDA and the other for the LAO concerned) will be 
forwarded to CDA and IFA concerned for such action as may be 
 considered necessary by them.   
15.12.2  Responsibility for Technical Matters. The responsibility in technical 
matters relating to the development shall rest with the Head of the 
Service/ Establishment / Directorate of Indigenisation / Laboratory/ 
 Workshop / Depot / Institution concerned.  
15.12.3 Inspections. There may be two to three inspections during the 
development stage and firms may be made more accountable for their 
product. They may be asked to furnish reports of various tests from the 
various laboratories as required by the Purchaser, The requirements are 
to be indicated in the approved Quality Assurance Plan (QAP).  A clause 
should be provided that in case it is subsequently found that the firm has 
used fraudulent means to obtain the report/s and the item developed is not 
as per specifications indicated in the RFP the firm will be blacklisted for a 
minimum period of three years from any future tender. Once an item has 
been declared as free flow, for further procurement the inspection will be 
done by the DGQA/DGAQA as per normal procedure. 
 
15.12.4   Monitoring Progress. Responsibility to monitor the progress and 
operation of the Development/Fabrication contract will rest with the 
authority that has entered into such contract.  The customer will provide 
necessary guidance to the firm as required from time to time and will 
maintain close liaison with them to clarify any doubts. The progress of 
development will be monitored closely and in case the progress is not 
found to be satisfactory, suitable action will be taken as provided for in the 
 contract. 
15.12.5  Return of Documents. Documents, specifications, drawings issued to 
the firms/contractors or prepared by them should be taken over as these 
belong to the Govt.  A provision to this effect should be made in the 
contracts.  Loss or damage to these documents shall be recoverable from 
the contractors.   
 
  
157
 15.13  Declaration of Free Flow 
15.13.1 Declaration of Item as Developed.  The indigenization of an item will 
be considered complete and the item declared as free flow under the 
 following conditions- 
(a)  When the initial quantity is not large enough to be split and/or 
the equipment/ system / item is a high tech complex one requiring 
substantial investment even at the time of development in terms of 
plant and machinery, the development of a single source and 
successful delivery against the order placed may be considered 
 sufficient to declare the item as developed. 
(b)    In all other cases, when at least one successful purchase is 
made and at least two sources are fully established, which would 
not only ensure price competition but also avert Government’s 
 dependence on any single source.  
(c)     Completion of codification of the item / equipment by the 
 AHSP (applicable in all cases). 
(d)   If a second source for the item is not developed under clause 
at serial (b) above within five years from the date of completion of 
the first supply order, the item may be declared as “free flow” i.e as 
developed thereafter; however, there could be exceptions with full 
justification where an item is declared free flow even earlier. 
 
15.13.2 Bulk Production by Agencies associated with Development. After 
the item has been declared as developed, the first bulk order will be 
placed on the production agency / agencies associated with the 
HQrs/Department in the development of the item and the following 
procedure will be adopted for this purpose:-  
 
(a) 
There should be a reservation of quantity not exceeding 50% 
of the initial order quantity for production agency (ies) associated 
 with the development of the product.  
(b) 
Where the initial quantity is not large enough to be split and / 
or the item is a high-tech one, requiring substantial investment even 
at the time of development in terms of plant and machinery, the 
 ordered quantity shall be covered on such production agency (ies).  
(c) 
In the case of (a) above, the price will be settled on the basis 
of competitive quotations by issuing a tender enquiry to other 
agencies who, though not associated with the development of the 
product, are considered competent to productionise the item. In 
  
158
such a case if the production agency associated with the 
development of the product quotes a price higher than the lowest 
acceptable offer, such agency shall be asked to match the lowest 
price, failing which they can be considered, for a price preference 
 not exceeding over the lowest acceptable offer.  
(d) 
In the case of (b) above, the quotations would be obtained 
only from the production agency associated with the development 
and price will be settled through a study of the various elements of 
 cost, the data for which will be furnished by the concerned agency.  
(e) 
The dispensation as indicated above shall be given to the 
production agency associated with the development only where 
their association is with regard to the development of an item which 
 can be separately procured.  
(f) 
Even in case the source is not already registered, the latest 
bulk order can be placed on them. However, their continuance as 
an established supplier of the item will be subject to their capacity 
verification 
and 
registration 
by 
the 
competent 
authority/ 
Department.  
 
15.14 Applicability of Other Chapters All design, indigenous development, 
indigenisation and fabrication contracts will be processed as per the 
provisions and procedures given in this Chapter. The policy, procedures 
and provisions contained elsewhere in the DPM would be applicable to 
Design, Development, Indigenisation and Fabrication Contracts only to the 
extent the subject is not specifically covered in this Chapter.

APPENDIX ‘C’  
 
Subsidiary Instructions to Buyer for framing Request For 
Proposal (RFP) 
 
1. The draft RFP is divided into five Parts, each Part dealing with a 
different aspects. 
 
2. Part I contains General Instructions to the bidders. Generally, all these 
instructions should be mentioned as it is, though minor changes can be 
done to suit a particular case. The para on EMD is applicable only for 
cases covered under Para 4.7 of Chapter IV.  
 
3. In Part II, the Technical Details would be different for various types of  
equipment. As such only the broad guidelines for formulating this 
aspect have been stated here. The information may contain the 
following – 
 
a. The purpose for which the items are needed or broadly outlines 
the capabilities that are required. It should be ensured that user 
requirements are laid down in a comprehensive, structured and 
concrete manner in terms of functional characteristics and are 
broad-based.  
 
b. Relevant technical parameters like size, weight, performance, 
operating environment, power, torque, preservation, utility life, 
storage, shelf life etc, can be specified as applicable. Examples 
are as under –  
i. User requirements in terms of functional characteristics 
ii. Specifications / Drawings, if applicable 
iii. Technical details along with Essential Technical 
parameters 
iv. Compliance chart for Technical evaluation 
v. Requirement of training / on-job training 
vi. Requirement of installation, Commissioning 
vii. Requirement of FATs, HATs and SATs. 
viii. Requirement of technical documentation. 
ix. Type of future assistance on completion of warranty. 
 
167 
x. Earliest Acceptable Year of manufacture 
c. In case of Two-Bid system, the essential performance 
parameters should be mentioned, fulfilment of which would be 
the basis for Technical Evaluation. 
 
d. In Para 5 pertaining to INCOTERMS, only the applicable Term of 
Delivery may be mentioned as decided for that particular case.   
 
4. Part III contains Standard clauses which might have a legal implication. 
Therefore, no deviation from the text given in the clauses nor deletion of 
any of these clauses has to be allowed. In case a deviation from these 
clauses has to be considered/allowed due to insistence of the Seller, 
then approval of Raksha Mantri will be required. Para 15 on Pre-
Integrity clause may be included only in cases above Rs. 100 crores.  
 
5. Part IV contains several Commercial clauses, which may or may not be 
relevant for a particular type of RFP. Hence the title is given as Special 
Conditions of Contract. A conscious decision may be taken to 
incorporate the relevant clauses from this list based on the guidelines 
given in the concerned Chapters of DPM-2009. The wordings of these 
clauses can also be appropriately modified to suit a particular case.  
 
6. In Part V, the Evaluation Criteria can be suitably amplified/modified to 
suit the specific requirements of a particular case. Similarly, the Format 
of the Price Bid can be amended to include / exclude items as per 
requirements. 
 
7. The draft RFP applies both to indigenous and foreign procurement 
cases. The main difference will be in the selection of relevant ‘Special 
Condition Clauses’ from those given in Part-IV of the draft RFP. This in 
turn will depend upon the guidelines contained in corresponding paras 
of various chapters. In particular, the provisions of Chapters 4 & 7 
would be relevant for indigenous procurements and Chapters 9 & 10 for 
foreign procurements must be examined by the Buyer for appropriate 
selection of commercial clauses.

 charges and no claim for the same will be entertained.

quoted prices, the Bidder must specifically say so.   In the absence 
of any such stipulation it will be presumed that the prices quoted are 
firm and final and no claim on account of such duty/tax will be 
entrained after the opening of tenders. 
 
3. If a Bidder chooses to quote a price inclusive of any duty/tax and 
does not confirm inclusive of such duty/tax so included is firm and 
final, he should clearly indicate the rate of such duty/tax and 
quantum of such duty/tax included in the price.  Failure to do so may 
result in ignoring of such offers summarily. 
 
4. If a Bidder is exempted from payment of any duty/tax upto any value 
of supplies from them, he should clearly state that no such duty/tax 
will be charged by him up to the limit of exemption which he may 
have. If any concession is available in regard to rate/quantum of any 
Duty/tax, it should be brought out clearly.  Stipulations like, the said 
duty/tax was presently not applicable but the same will be charged if 
it becomes leviable later on, will not be accepted unless in such 
cases it is clearly stated by a Bidder that such duty/tax will not be 
charged by him even if the same becomes applicable later on.  In 
respect of the Bidders, who fail to comply with this requirement, their 
quoted prices shall be loaded with the quantum of such duty/tax 
 
179

maintenance tools, test equipment and technical literature. MET details 
will be given as per format given at Form DPM-20 (Available in MoD 
website and can be given on request).  To facilitate this process the 
Bidder is required to provide the following :-  
i. Technical Literature. 
1. User Handbook/Operators Manual in English and Hindi. 
2. Design Specifications. 
3. Technical Manuals. 
a. Part I Tech description, specifications, functioning of

208 
33. Price Variation (PV) Clause – The following PV clause will form part of the 
contract placed on successful Bidder (Note - DGS&D Manual provides 
Standardised Price Variation Clauses. Any of those clauses could be 
considered for inclusion. A sample clause is indicated below) –  
 
a. The formula for Price Variation should ordinarily include a fixed element, a 
material element and a labour element.  The figures representing the 
material element and the labour element should reflect the corresponding 
proportion of input costs, while the fixed element may range from 10 to 
25%.  That portion of the price represented by the fixed element, will not 
be subject to variation.  The portions of the price represented by the 
material element and labour element along will attract Price Variation.  
The formula for Price Variation will thus be :- 
   
P1 = Po             F + a     M1       + b       L1       - Po       
 
 
 
 
Mo                            Lo  
 
 
Where P1 is then adjustment amount payable to the supplier (a minus 
 figure will indicate a reduction in the Contract Price) 
 Po  is the Contract Price at the base level. 
 F is the Fixed element not subject to Price Variation  
 a  is the assigned percentage to the material element in the Contract Price. 
 b  is the assigned percentage to the labour element in the Contract Price. 
Lo  and L1  are the wage indices at the base month and year and at the 
 month and year of calculation respectively. 
Mo and M1  are the material indices at the base month and year and at the 
month and year of calculation respectively. 
 
If more than one major item of material is involved, the material element 
can be broken up into two or three components such as Mx, My, Mz .  Where 
price variation clause has to be provided for services (with insignificant 
inputs of materials) as for example, in getting Technical Assistance 
normally paid in the form of per diem rates, the price variation formula 
should have only two elements, viz. a high fixed element and a labour 
element.  The fixed element can in such cases be 50% or more, depending 
on the mark-up by the supplier of the Per Diem rate vis-a-vis the wage 
 rates. 
 
209 
 
b. Following conditions would be applicable to Price Adjustment –  
i.  Base dates shall be due dates of opening of price bids. 
ii. Date of adjustment shall be mid point of manufacture. 
iii. No price increase is allowed beyond original DP unless the delay is 
attributable to the Buyer. 
iv.  Total adjustment will be subject to maximum ceiling of ____%. 
v. No price adjustment shall be payable on the portion of contract price 
paid to the Seller as an advance payment. 
                                 
 
210 
 
Part V – Evaluation Criteria & Price Bid issues 
 
1. 
Evaluation Criteria - The broad guidelines for evaluation of Bids will be as 
follows: 
 
a. Only those Bids will be evaluated which are found to be fulfilling all the 
eligibility and qualifying requirements of the RFP, both technically and 
 commercially.  
b. In respect of Two-Bid system, the technical Bids forwarded by the 
Bidders will be evaluated by the Buyer with reference to the technical 
characteristics of the equipment as mentioned in the RFP. The 
compliance of Technical Bids would be determined on the basis of the 
parameters specified in the RFP. The Price Bids of only those Bidders 
will be opened whose Technical Bids would clear the technical 
evaluation. 
 
c. The Lowest Bid will be decided upon the lowest price quoted by the 
particular Bidder as per the Price Format given at Para 2 below. The 
consideration of taxes and duties in evaluation process will be as follows: 
 
i. In cases where only indigenous Bidders are competing, all taxes and 
duties (including those for which exemption certificates are issued) 
quoted by the Bidders will be considered. The ultimate cost to the 
 Buyer would be the deciding factor for ranking of Bids.  
ii. In cases where both foreign and indigenous Bidders are competing,  
following criteria would be followed –  
 
1. In case of foreign Bidders, the basic cost (CIF) quoted by them 
would be the basis for the purpose of comparison of various 
tenders. 
 
2. In case of indigenous Bidders, excise duty on fully formed 
equipment would be offloaded. 
 
3. Sales tax and other local levies, i.e. octroi, entry tax etc would be 
ignored in case of indigenous Bidders.  
 
d. The Bidders are required to spell out the rates of Customs duty, Excise 
duty, VAT, Service Tax, etc in unambiguous terms; otherwise their offers 
will be loaded with the maximum rates of duties and taxes for the purpose 
of comparison of prices. If reimbursement of Customs duty / Excise Duty / 
VAT is intended as extra, over the quoted prices, the Bidder must 
specifically say so.   In the absence of any such stipulation it will be 
 
211 
presumed that the prices quoted are firm and final and no claim on 
account of such duties will be entrained after the opening of tenders. If a 
Bidder chooses to quote a price inclusive of any duty and does not 
confirm inclusive of such duty so included is firm and final, he should 
clearly indicate the rate of such duty and quantum of excise duty included 
in the price.  Failure to do so may result in ignoring of such offers 
summarily. If a Bidder is exempted from payment of Customs duty / 
Excise Duty / VAT duty upto any value of supplies from them, they should 
clearly state that no excise duty will be charged by them up to the limit of 
exemption which they may have.   If any concession is available in regard 
to rate/quantum of Customs duty / Excise Duty / VAT, it should be 
brought out clearly.  Stipulations like, excise duty was presently not 
applicable but the same will be charged if it becomes leviable later on, 
will not be accepted unless in such cases it is clearly stated by a Bidder 
that excise duty will not be charged by him even if the same becomes 
applicable later on.  In respect of the Bidders who fail to comply with this 
requirement, their quoted prices shall be loaded with the quantum of 
excise duty which is normally applicable on the item in question for the 
purpose of comparing their prices with other Bidders. The same logic 
applies to Customs duty and VAT also. 
 
e. In import cases, all the foreign quotes will be brought to a common 
denomination in Indian Rupees by adopting the exchange rate as BC 
Selling rate of the State Bank of India on the date of the opening of Price 
Bids.  
 
f.   If there is a discrepancy between the unit price and the total price that is 
obtained by multiplying the unit price and quantity, the unit price will 
prevail and the total price will be corrected. If there is a discrepancy 
between words and figures, the amount in words will prevail for 
calculation of price.  
 
g. The Buyer reserves the right to evaluate the offers received by using 
Discounted Cash Flow method at a discounting rate of ______%. In case 
cash flow involves more than one currency, the same will be brought to a 
common denomination in Indian Rupees by adopting exchange rate as 
BC Selling rate of the State Bank of India on the date of the opening of 
Price Bids. 
 
h. The Lowest Acceptable Bid will be considered further for placement of 
contract / Supply Order after complete clarification and price negotiations 
as decided by the Buyer. The Buyer will have the right to award contracts 
to different Bidders for being lowest in particular items. The Buyer also 
reserves the right to do Apportionment of Quantity, if it is convinced that 
Lowest Bidder is not in a position to supply full quantity in stipulated time.

i. Unit level repairs - These are repairs carried out within the unit 
holding this equipment with tools generally held within the unit or 
supplied by the manufacturer with each equipment or as per 
scaling of 1:10 or any other scaling recommended by the 
manufacturer as per population held in the unit. These pertain to 
cleaning, lubrications, minor repairs and replacement of 
components and minor assemblies that can be carried out in field 
without any sophisticated tools or test equipment. For carrying 
out such repairs, the manufacturer is required to provide the 
 following:-  
1. Table of Tools and Equipment (TOTE) with each 
equipment including operators manual. 
 
2. Scaling of special tools and spares as mentioned above 
including Maintenance manual. 
 
ii. Field Repairs – These are repairs carried out in the field by 
technicians specially trained for this purpose and where the 
required special tools and spares have to be provided. These 
repairs comprise replacement of major assemblies and other 
components beyond the scope of unit level repairs. Normally a 
field work shop that carries out such repairs looks after three to 
four units holding the said equipment. The manufacturer is 
 required to provide the following:-  
1. Quantity and specification of spares that need to be 
stocked for a population of ________ equipment. 
 
2. Special Maintenance Tools and Test Equipment that need 
to be provided to each such field work shop. (The total 
number of such facilities would also have to be stated 
based on deployment pattern of the concerned equipment 
to carryout total costing). 
 
iii. Base overhaul - All repairs including repairs to components, 
subassemblies and overhaul of the complete equipment are 
carried out by this facility. Depending on the population of the 
equipment, one to five such facilities may be established in India 
 
246 
for this purpose (The actual No would have to be stated for 
 costing).The manufacturer is required to provide the following:- 
1. All Special Maintenance Tools, jigs, fixtures and test 
equipment for carrying out repairs up to component level. 
2. Quantity and specification of spares, sub assemblies as 
per population expected to be maintained. 
3. Oils and lubricants necessary for overhaul. 
4. All necessary technical literature. 
5. Calibration facilities for test equipment.This level of repair 
defines stripping and rebuilding of equipment in a Base

b. Manufacturers Recommended List of Spares (MRLS). -  Based on the 
explanation given above, Bidders are requested to provide MRLS to 
sustain the equipment for a period of ---- years for various levels of 
repair as per format given at Form DPM-19 (Available in MoD website 
and can be given on request). Bidders will be required to provide these 
both with Technical and Commercial proposals. (In case where the 
equipment has been in usage the spares would be sought by Buyer, on 
the recommended list to be furnished by the maintenance agency, 
based on the exploitation of the equipment, and NOT as per MRLS).  
While with the commercial proposal, the actual costs of each 
component/spare will be provided, in the case of Technical Proposal 
these will be reflected as Low Cost/ Medium Cost/High Cost. A 
guideline for this purpose is as under:-

equipment/subsystem. 
 
If the complete equipment comprises a number of different sub systems, 
for e.g. it is coming mounted on a vehicle or is provided with a stand for 
mounting or is inclusive of a generator or an air conditioner or has a sight, 
the MRLS must be provided separately for each such sub system.  
 
c. Special Maintenance Tools and Test Equipment - This is to be 
formulated in a similar manner as explained for MRLS. A suggested 
format is given at Form DPM-17 (Available in MoD website and can be 
given on request) and is to be included in both Technical and 
 
247 
Commercial Proposals. The cost column may be left blank in the 
Technical Proposal.  
 
d. Technical Literature - The details of technical literature to be supplied 
with the system should be listed as per the suggested format at Form 
DPM-18 (Available in MoD website and can be given on request). This 
should be provided with both Technical and Commercial Proposals. The 
cost column may be left blank in the Technical Proposal.  
 
e. Miscellaneous Aspects (Applicable only when trials are required) - In 
cases where the equipment is required to undergo trials, the equipment 
will also be put through Maintenance Evaluation Test. Based on this 
evaluation and in consultation with the supplier, the MRLS may be 
refined. During user trials it may be brought out that the equipment is 
acceptable subject to carrying out certain modifications / improvements. 
 
f. Maintainability Evaluation Trials (MET). This is carried with a view to 
facilitate provisioning of effective engineering support during life cycle of 
the equipment. This would involve stripping of the equipment and 
carrying out recommended tests and adjustments and establishing 
adequacy of maintenance tools, test equipment and technical literature. 
To facilitate this process the Bidder is required to provide the                
following :-

 ESP / MRLS should agree to buy back the surplus spares.  
33.  Price Variation (PV) Clause –  
a. The formula for Price Variation should ordinarily include a fixed 
element, a material element and a labour element.  The figures 
representing the material element and the labour element should reflect 
the corresponding proportion of input costs, while the fixed element may 
range from 10 to 25%.  That portion of the price represented by the 
fixed element, will not be subject to variation.  The portions of the price 
represented by the material element and labour element along will 
attract Price Variation.  The formula for Price Variation will thus be :- 
   
P1 = Po             F + a     M1       + b       L1       - Po       
 
 
 
 
Mo                            Lo  
 
 
Where P1 is then adjustment amount payable to the supplier (a minus 
 figure will indicate a reduction in the Contract Price) 
 Po  is the Contract Price at the base level. 
 
249 
 F is the Fixed element not subject to Price Variation  
 a  is the assigned percentage to the material element in the Contract Price. 
 b  is the assigned percentage to the labour element in the Contract Price. 
Lo  and L1  are the wage indices at the base month and year and at the 
 month and year of calculation respectively. 
Mo and M1  are the material indices at the base month andyeazr and at the 
month and year of calculation respectively. 
 
If more than one major item of material is involved, the material element 
can be broken up into two or three components such as Mx, My, Mz .  Where 
price variation clause has to be provided for services (with insignificant 
inputs of materials) as for example, in getting Technical Assistance 
normally paid in the form of per diem rates, the price variation formula 
should have only two elements, viz. a high fixed element and a labour 
element.  The fixed element can in such cases be 50% or more, depending 
on the mark-up by the supplier of the Per Diem rate vis-a-vis the wage 
rates. 
 
b. Following conditions would be applicable to Price Adjustment –  
i.  Base dates shall be due dates of opening of price bids. 
ii. Date of adjustment shall be mid point of manufacture. 
iii. No price increase is allowed beyond original DP unless the delay 
is attributable to the Buyer. 
iv.  Total adjustment will be subject to maximum ceiling of ____%. 
v. No price adjustment shall be payable on the portion of contract 
price paid to the Seller as an advance payment.

32. Engineering Support Package (ESP) clause - The following ESP clause will form 
 part of the contract placed on successful Bidder – 
a. Repair Philosophy: The Engineering Support Philosophy shall conform to 
the repair philosophy as follows: 
 
281 
i. Unit level repairs - These are repairs carried out within the unit holding 
this equipment with tools generally held within the unit or supplied by the 
manufacturer with each equipment or as per scaling of 1:10 or any other 
scaling recommended by the manufacturer as per population held in the 
unit. These pertain to cleaning, lubrications, minor repairs and 
replacement of components and minor assemblies that can be carried 
out in field without any sophisticated tools or test equipment. For 
carrying out such repairs, the manufacturer is required to provide the 
 following:-  
1. Table of Tools and Equipment (TOTE) with each equipment 
including operators manual. 
2. Scaling of special tools and spares as mentioned above 
including Maintenance manual. 
 
vi. Field Repairs – These are repairs carried out in the field by 
technicians specially trained for this purpose and where the required 
special tools and spares have to be provided. These repairs 
comprise replacement of major assemblies and other components 
beyond the scope of unit level repairs. Normally a field work shop 
that carries out such repairs looks after three to four units holding 
the said equipment. The manufacturer is required to provide the 
 following:-  
1. Quantity and specification of spares that need to be stocked for 
a population of ________ equipment. 
 
2. Special Maintenance Tools and Test Equipment that need to 
be provided to each such field work shop. (The total number of 
such facilities would also have to be stated based on 
deployment pattern of the concerned equipment to carryout 
total costing). 
 
vii. Base overhaul - All repairs including repairs to components, 
subassemblies and overhaul of the complete equipment are carried 
out by this facility. Depending on the population of the equipment, 
one to five such facilities may be established in India for this 
purpose (The actual No would have to be stated for costing).The 
 manufacturer is required to provide the following:- 
1. All Special Maintenance Tools, jigs, fixtures and test equipment 
for carrying out repairs up to component level. 
 
2. Quantity and specification of spares, sub assemblies as per 
population expected to be maintained. 
 
 
282 
3. Oils and lubricants necessary for overhaul. 
 
4. All necessary technical literature. 
 
5. Calibration facilities for test equipment.This level of repair 
defines stripping and rebuilding of equipment in a Base 
workshop. 
 
b. Manufacturers Recommended List of Spares (MRLS). -  Based on the 
explanation given above, Bidders are requested to provide MRLS to 
sustain the equipment for a period of ---- years for various levels of repair 
as per format given at Form DPM-19 (Available in MoD website and can 
be given on request). Bidders will be required to provide these both with 
Technical and Commercial proposals. (In case where the equipment has 
been in usage the spares would be sought by Buyer, on the 
recommended list to be furnished by the maintenance agency, based on 
the exploitation of the equipment, and NOT as per MRLS).  While with the 
commercial proposal, the actual costs of each component/spare will be 
provided, in the case of Technical Proposal these will be reflected as Low 
Cost/ Medium Cost/High Cost. A guideline for this purpose is as under:-  
 
i. Low Cost. Less than 2 % of the unit cost of the 
 equipment/sub system. 
ii. Medium Cost. 2 to 10% of the unit cost of the equipment/sub 
system. 
 
iii. High Cost. Greater than 10 % of the unit cost of 
equipment/subsystem. 
 
If the complete equipment comprises a number of different sub systems, 
for eg it is coming mounted on a vehicle or is provided with a stand for 
mounting or is inclusive of a generator or an air conditioner or has a sight, 
 the MRLS must be provided separately for each such sub system.  
c. Special Maintenance Tools and Test Equipment - This is to be 
formulated in a similar manner as explained for MRLS. A suggested 
format is given at Form DPM-17 (Available in MoD website and can be 
given on request) and is to be included in both Technical and Commercial 
Proposals. The cost column may be left blank in the Technical Proposal.  
 
d. Technical Literature - The details of technical literature to be supplied with 
the system should be listed as per the suggested format at Form DPM-18 
(Available in MoD website and can be given on request). This should be 
provided with both Technical and Commercial Proposals. The cost column 
may be left blank in the Technical Proposal.  
 
283 
 
e. Miscellaneous Aspects (Applicable only when trials are required) - In 
cases where the equipment is required to undergo trials, the equipment 
will also be put through Maintenance Evaluation Test. Based on this 
evaluation and in consultation with the supplier, the MRLS may be refined. 
During user trials it may be brought out that the equipment is acceptable 
subject to carrying out certain modifications / improvements. 
 
f. Maintainability Evaluation Trials (MET). This is carried with a view to 
facilitate provisioning of effective engineering support during life cycle of 
the equipment. This would involve stripping of the equipment and carrying 
out recommended tests and adjustments and establishing adequacy of 
maintenance tools, test equipment and technical literature. MET details 
will be given as per format given at Form DPM-20 (Available in MoD 
website and can be given on request). To facilitate this process the Bidder 
is required to provide the following :-  
 
i. Technical Literature. 
1. User Handbook/Operators Manual in English and

g. Vendors quoting lesser ESP / MRLS in terms of range and depth will have 
to make good the deficiency. The vendors quoting surplus items in ESP / 
 MRLS should agree to buy back the surplus spares.  
33. Price Variation (PV) Clause – The following PV clause will form part of the 
contract placed on successful Bidder (Note - DGS&D Manual provides 
Standardised Price Variation Clauses. Any of those clauses could be considered 
for inclusion. A sample clause is indicated below) –  
c. The formula for Price Variation should ordinarily include a fixed element, a 
material element and a labour element.  The figures representing the 
material element and the labour element should reflect the corresponding 
proportion of input costs, while the fixed element may range from 10 to 
25%.  That portion of the price represented by the fixed element, will not 
be subject to variation.  The portions of the price represented by the 
material element and labour element along will attract Price Variation.  
The formula for Price Variation will thus be :- 
   
P1 = Po             F + a     M1       + b       L1       - Po       
 
 
 
 
Mo                            Lo  
 
 
Where P1 is then adjustment amount payable to the supplier (a minus 
 figure will indicate a reduction in the Contract Price) 
 Po  is the Contract Price at the base level. 
 F is the Fixed element not subject to Price Variation  
 a  is the assigned percentage to the material element in the Contract Price. 
 b  is the assigned percentage to the labour element in the Contract Price. 
Lo  and L1  are the wage indices at the base month and year and at the 
 month and year of calculation respectively. 
 
285 
Mo and M1 are the material indices at the base month and year and at the 
month and year of calculation respectively. 
 
If more than one major item of material is involved, the material element 
can be broken up into two or three components such as Mx, My, Mz .  Where 
price variation clause has to be provided for services (with insignificant 
inputs of materials) as for example, in getting Technical Assistance 
normally paid in the form of per diem rates, the price variation formula 
should have only two elements, viz. a high fixed element and a labour 
element.  The fixed element can in such cases be 50% or more, depending 
on the mark-up by the supplier of the Per Diem rate vis-a-vis the wage 
rates. 
 
d. Following conditions would be applicable to Price Adjustment –  
i.  Base dates shall be due dates of opening of price bids. 
ii. Date of adjustment shall be mid point of manufacture. 
iii. No price increase is allowed beyond original DP unless the delay is 
attributable to the Buyer. 
iv.  Total adjustment will be subject to maximum ceiling of ____%. 
v. No price adjustment shall be payable on the portion of contract price 
paid to the Seller as an advance payment.

Purchase/Price Preference Policy for Kendriya Bhandar / NCCF   
 
F.No. 14/12/94-(Welfare(Vol.II) 
Government of India 
Ministry of Personnel Public Grievances and Pensions 
Departmental of Personnel and Training (Welfare Section) 
Room No. 361, 3rd floor, Lok Nayak Bhawan, New Delhi 
Dated 5.7.2007 
OFFICE MEMORANDUM 
Subject : Local purchase of stationery and other articles from Kendriya               
Bhandar, NCCF and other Multi-State Co-operative Societies having               
 majority shareholding by the Central Government.  
1. In terms of Deptt. of Personnel & AR’s O.M.No. 14/4/80 Welfare dated 
14.7.1981, it was made incumbent on all Central Government 
Departments, their attached and subordinate offices and other 
organizations and/or controlled by the Government located at Delhi/New 
Delhi to make all local purchases of stationery and other items required by 
them only from the Central Government Employees Consumer 
Cooperative Society Ltd. (Kendriya Bhandar) New Delhi. Only if the 
Society was not able to supply a particular items, was it permissible for 
them to make local purchase from other sources. Subsequently, 
Instructions were issued in 1987 and 1994 bringing Super Bazar & NCCF 
(National Consumer Co-operative Federation) under the purview of 
DOP&T O.M. dated 14.7.1981.  
 
2. After the issuance of new General Financial Rules, 2005, the above 
dispensations stood withdrawn from 1.7.2005.  
 
3. The matter has since been reviewed in consultation with the Department 
of Expenditure. The concept of providing an assured market to Kendriya 
Bhandar (KB), NCCF or any other MSCS is not in keeping with the 
concept of liberalization of the economy and making the Government 
organizations competitive  and self supporting through open competition. 
However, keeping in view the avowed objective of the co-operative 
movement to ensure supply of goods and services to the consumers at 
the most economical and competitive prices and taking note of the 
changes concepts of marketing, it has been decided to adopt the following 
dispensation in respect of all Central Government Departments, their

their discretion of all items required for office consumption up to Rs. 
1 lakh on each occasion directly from Kendriya Bhandar/NCCF 
without calling for quotation. The responsibility for ensuring the 
reasonableness or rates, quality, specifications, etc. should be

be invited to participate in such limited tenders. In case these 
cooperative are functioning at the station. Other things being equal, 
purchase preference will be granted to KB/NCCF, if the price quoted 
by the co-operative is within 1-% of the L1 price and if these

INCOTERMS – 2000 
 
 
1. 
In INCOTERMS 2000, the delivery and transportation of goods are 
 grouped into four categories as under: - 
(a) 
“E” – Terms - 
Implies Ex-works, where under, the seller only 
makes the goods available to the buyer at the seller’s own premises.  The 
 responsibility of providing the carrier is that of the buyer.  
(b) 
“F”-Terms- FCA, FAS and FOB are various clauses of “F” terms 
under which the seller is called upon to deliver the goods to a carrier 
appointed by the buyer.  The responsibility of providing the carrier is that 
 of the buyer. 
(c) 
“C”-Terms- CFR, CIF, CPT and CIP are various clauses of “C” 
terms under which the seller has to contract for carriage, but without 
assuming the risk of loss of or damage the goods or additional costs due 
 to events occurring after shipment and dispatch. 
(d) 
“D”- Terms- DAF, DES, DEQ, DDU and DDP are various clauses 
of “D” terms under which the seller has to bear costs and risks needed to 
 bring the goods to the placed of destination.  
2. 
Ex-works (EXW) 
“Ex-Works” means that the seller delivers when he 
places the goods at the disposal of the buyer at the seller’s premises or another 
named place (i.e., works, factory, warehouse, etc.) not cleared for export and not 
loaded on any collecting vehicle.  This term thus represents the minimum 
obligation for the seller, and the buyer has to bear all costs and risks involved in 
 taking the goods from the seller’s premises.  
3. 
However, if the parties wish the seller to be responsible for loading of the 
goods on departure and to bear the risks and all the costs of such loading, this 
should be made clear by adding explicit wording to this effect in the contract of 
sale.  This term should not be used when the buyer cannot carry out the export 
formalities directly or indirectly.  In such circumstances, the FCA term should be 
used provided the seller agrees that he will load at his cost and risk. 
4. 
Free Carrier (FCA)- 
“Free Carrier” means that the seller delivers 
the goods, cleared for export, to the carrier nominated by the buyer at the named 
place.  This terms may be used irrespective of the mode of transport, including 
multi-modal transport.  “Carrier” means any person who, in a contract of carriage, 
undertakes to perform or to procure the performance of transport by rail, road, 
air, sea, inland waterway or by a combination of such modes.  If the buyer 
nominates a person other than a carrier to receive the goods, the seller is 
 
356 
deemed to have fulfilled his obligation to deliver the goods when they are 
 delivered to that person.   
5. 
Free Alongside Ship(FAS)- 
“Free Alongside Ship” means that the 
seller delivers when the goods are placed alongside the vessel at the named port 
of shipment. This means that the buyer has to bear all costs and risks of loss of 
or damage to the goods from that moment.  The FAS term requires the buyer to 
clear the goods for export.  However, if parties wish the buyer to clear goods for 
export, this should be made clear by adding explicit wording to this effect in 
contract of sale.  This term can only be used for sea or inland waterway 
 transport. 
6. 
Free on Board (FOB)- 
“Free on Board” means that the seller delivers 
when the goods pass the ship’s rail at the named port of shipment.  This means 
that the buyer has to bear all costs and risks of loss of or damage to the goods 
from the point.  The FOB term requires the seller to clear the goods for export.  
This term can be used only for sea or inland waterway transport.  If the parties do 
not intend to deliver the goods across the ship’s rail, the FCA term should be 
 used.  
7. 
Cost and Freight (CFR)- “Cost and Freight” means that the seller has 
delivered when the goods pass the ship’s rail in the port of shipment.  The seller 
must pay the cost and freight necessary to bring the goods to the named port of 
destination but the risk of loss of or damage to the goods, or any additional costs 
due to events occurring after the time of delivery, are transferred from the seller 
to the buyer.  The CFR term requires the seller to clear the goods for export.  
 This term can be used only for sea and inland waterway transport.  
8. 
Cost, Insurance and Freight (CIF)- 
“Cost, Insurance and Freight” 
(CIF) means that the seller delivers when the goods pass the ship’s rail in the 
port of shipment.  The seller must pay the costs and freight necessary to bring 
the goods to the named port of destination.  In case of CIF term, the seller also 
has to procure marine insurance against the buyer’s risk of loss of or damage to 
the goods during the carriage.  Consequently, the seller contracts for insurance 
and pays the insurance premium.   The CIF term requires the seller to clear the 
goods for export.  This term can be used only for sea and inland waterway 
transport.  If the parties do not intend to deliver the goods across the ship’s rail, 
 the CIP term should be used.  
9. 
Carriage Paid To (CPT)- “Carriage Paid to (CPT)” means that the seller 
delivers the goods to the carrier nominated by him but the seller must in addition 
pay the cost of carriage necessary to bring the goods to be named destination.  
This means that the buyer bears all risks and any other cost occurring after the 
goods have been so delivered.  The CPT term requires the seller to clear the 
goods for export.  The term may be used irrespective of the mode of transport 
including multi-modal transport.  
 
357 
 
10. 
Carriage and Insurance Paid To (CIP)- “Carriage and Insurance Paid To 
(CIP)” means that the seller delivers goods to the carrier nominated by him, but 
the seller must in addition pay cost of carriage necessary to bring goods to be 
named destination.  This means that the buyer bears all risks and any additional 
cost occurring after the goods have been so delivered.  However, in CIP, the 
seller also has to procure insurance against the buyer’s risk of loss of or damage 
to the goods during the carriage.  Consequently, the seller contracts for 
 insurance and pays the insurance premium.  
11. 
The buyer should note that under the CIP term, the seller is required to 
obtain insurance only on minimum cover.  Should the buyer wish to have the 
protection of greater cover, he would either need to agree as much expressly 
with the seller or to make his own extra insurance arrangements. “Carrier” means 
any person who, in a contract of carriage, undertakes to perform or to procure 
the performance of transport by rail, road, air sea, inland waterway or by a 
combination of such modes.  If subsequent carriers are used for the carriage to 
the agreed destination, the risk passes when the goods have been delivered to 
the first carrier.  The CIP requires the seller to clear the goods for export.  This 
term may be used irrespective of the mode of transport including multi-modal 
 transport.  
12. 
Delivered at Frontier (DAF)- 
“Delivered at Frontier” means that the 
seller delivers when the goods are at the disposal of the buyer on the arriving 
means of transport not unloaded, cleared for export, but not cleared for import at 
the named point and place at the frontier, but before the customs border of the 
adjoining country. However, if the parties wish, the seller to be responsible for the 
unloading of goods from the arriving means of transport and bear the risks and 
costs of unloading, this should be made clear by adding explicit wording to this 
effect in the contract of sale.  This term should not be used irrespective of the 
 mode of transport when goods are to be delivered at a land frontier. 
13. 
Delivered Ex-Ship (DES)- “Delivered Ex-Ship” means that the seller fulfils 
his obligation to deliver when the goods have been made available to the buyer 
on board the ship un-cleared for import at the named port of destination.  The 
seller has to bear all the costs and risk involved in brining the goods to the 
named port of destination before discharging.  If the parties wish, the seller to 
bear the costs and risks of discharging the goods, then the DEQ term should be 
used.  The term can only be used only when the goods are to be delivered by 
 sea or inland water way transport on a vessel in the port of destination.  
14. 
Delivered Ex-Quay (Duty Paid) (DEQ)- “Delivered Ex-Quay (Duty Paid)” 
means that the seller fulfils his obligation to deliver when he has made the goods 
available to the buyer on the quay (Wharf) at the named port of destination, 
cleared for importation.  The seller has to bear all risks and costs including 
 
358 
duties, taxes and other charges of delivering the goods thereto.  This term should  
not be used if the seller is unable directly or indirectly to obtain the import license.  
If the parties wish the buyer to clear the goods for importation and pay the duty, 
 the words “ duty unpaid” should be used instead for “duty paid”. 
15. 
Documents- In all cases of foreign contracts, the suppliers should forward 
to the purchaser copies of all documents concerning delivery and payment, by 
speed post, courier or other fastest means of dispatch. This should be in addition 
to the documents dispatched to the bank for payment through Letter of Credit.  
The supplier should give at least six weeks notice, with regard to the readiness of 
the consignment, to the purchaser and his agent.  The date of bill of lading or 
airway bill will be considered as the actual date of delivery with reference to the 
 stipulated date of delivery in the contract.  
16. 
Consignee’s Right of Rejection- Notwithstanding the fact that an item 
may have been inspected prior to dispatch, the consignee will have the right to 
reject it, in whole or part, if it is observed that the item supplied does not conform 
to the specifications or has been damaged.  Such rejection will be communicated 
to the supplier within 90 days of the item reaching the consignee’s premise.  If an 
item is rejected, the supplier is required to replace the item within a period 
determined by the supplier, which should not be less than 45 days, failing which 
he shall make financial restitution base don’t he order value.  However, in all 
such cases the provisions contained in the International Chamber of Commerce 
Publication, INCOTERM 2000, including that regarding change of the right of 
property, as amended from time to time, will be considered as foreign contracts 
 are governed by international laws.

 of Foreign Banks by Indian Banks 
 
1. In terms of Reserve Bank of India’s guidelines issued vide letter No AP (DIR 
Series) Circular No 15 dated 17 September, 2003, all remittances of foreign 
exchange beyond US$ 100,000 are to be against BGs/stand by Letter of Credit 
from banks of international repute. Accordingly, Ministry of Defence will obtain 
Bank Guarantees (BGs) from foreign suppliers from banks of international repute 
for:- 
(a) Advances paid to them. 
(b) Performance of contracts as Performance BGs. 
(c) Warranty bonds to ensure warranty support of equipments supplied by the 
 vendors. 
2. To ascertain whether BGs given by foreign vendors are from banks of 
international repute, Ministry of Defence will be assisted by the Parliament Street 
 Branch of SBI.  
3. With a view to institutionalize the procedure to be adopted for obtaining advice 
of State Bank of India, an Arrangement Letter has been signed with SBI which 
 covers the services that SBI will offer. 
4. While CNC commences its commercial deliberations, SBI’s advice on the BG 
will be sought in parallel. The advisory role of SBI will be put into action in the 
 following manner- 
(a) On receiving details of BG proposed to be submitted by the vendor, the 
 matter is to be referred to SBI. 
(b) SBI will render its advice within 7 days from the date of receipt of 
reference/details of the BG from MoD. 
 
(c) SBI’s advice will be as follows:- 
(i) In case the BG is from a bank of international repute and country rating 
is satisfactory, SBI will advise MoD to accept BG without need for 
 confirmation of the BG by an Indian bank. 
(ii) In case the advice of SBI is that the BG is not from a bank of 
international repute and / or a confirmation of a local bank is required to be 
obtained by MoD, the vendor will be asked by MoD to instruct its banker to 
mutually settle the issue of BG with SBI who will in turn advise MoD 
 regarding further action to be taken. 
 
375 
(iii) Only in case the vendor’s bank is unable to settle the issue of BG with 
 SBI, the matter will be referred back to MoD by SBI. 
(iv) In such cases, as required, MoD will associate SBI officials in Contract 
Negotiation Committee (CNC) for settling the issue of BG with the
